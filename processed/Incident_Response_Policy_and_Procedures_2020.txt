management, and it should be ensured that those responsible for Security Incident 
management understand the organization’s priorities for handling Security Incidents.  
 
• Security Even ts should be reported through appropriate management channels as quickly 
as possible.  
 
• Personnel and contractors using the organization’s information systems and services are 
required to note and report any observed or suspected Security Weakness in system s or 
services.  
 
• Security Events should be assessed and it should be decided if they are to be classified 
as Security Incidents.  
 
• Security Incidents should be responded to in accordance with documented Incident 
Response procedures.  
 
• Knowledge gained from a nalyzing and resolving Security Incidents should be used to 
reduce the likelihood or impact of future incidents.  
 
• Procedures should be defined and applied for the identification, collection, acquisition, and 
preservation of information, which can serve as evidence.  
 
• Awareness should be provided on topics such as:

9. PROCESS  
 
 
 
 
9.1. Detection Phase  
In the detection phase the SIRT, or an internal or external entity, identifies a Security Event 
that may be  the result of a potential exploitation of a Security Vulnerability or a Security 
Weakness , or that may be the result of an innocent error .   
Immediately upon observation or notice of any suspected Security Event, Personnel shall use 
reasonable efforts to promptly report such knowledge and/or suspicion to the Information 
Security  Department  at the following address:  
• Email: InformationSecurity@icims.com  
 
A Security Event may be discovered in many ways, including the following:  
• Observation of suspicious behavior or unusual occurrences ; 
• Lapses in physical or procedural security;  
• Information coming into the possession of unauthorized Personnel or Third Parties ; 
• Information inappropriately exposed on a publicly facing website.   
 
To assess whether a Security Event must be reported, Personnel should consider whether 
there are indications that:  
• Information was used by unauthorized Personnel or Third Parties;  

Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 10                           • Information has been downloaded or copied inappropriately from iCIMS's  
computer systems or equipment;  
• Equipment or devices containing Information have been lost or stolen;  
• Equipment or device s containing Information have been subject to unauthorized 
activity (e.g., hacking, malware).  
• Personal Data has been publicly exposed  
 
In addition, the following situations should be considered for Security E vent reporting:  
• Ineffective security controls;  
• Breach of information integrity, confidentiality or availability expectations;  
• Human errors  (innocent or otherwise) ; 
• Non–compliance with policies or standards;  
• Breaches of physical security arrangements;  
• Uncontrolled systems changes;  
• Malfunctions of softwa re or hardware;  
• Access violations.  
 
Even if Personnel are not sure whether a Security Event is an actual Security Incident they 
are still required to report it as provided herein, as it is better to be cautious than to be 
compromised.  
The SIRT  will usually  require the reporter to supply further information, which will depend upon 
the nature of the Security Event. However, the following information normally shall  be 
supplied:  
• Contact name and information of person reporting the Security Event;  
• Date and time the Security Event occurred  or was noticed ; 
• Type and circumstances of the Security Event;  
• The type of data, information, or equipment involved;  
• Location of the Security Event, data or equipment affected;  
• Whether the Security Event puts any person or other data at risk; and  
• Any associated ticket numbers, emails or log entries associated with the Security 
Event.  
 
SIRT Primary Lead  will ensure that the SIRT is promptly engaged once  such notice  is 
received . The following actions will also be taken:  
1. The SIRT, un der the leadership of the SIRT Primary Lead , shall use reasonable 
efforts to analyze the matter within four (4) hours of notice and decide whether to 
proceed with the Analysis Phase of the Incident Response Procedures.  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 11                           a. Determination to initiate the Analysi s Phase must be made quickly so 
that Personnel can make an initial determination as to the urgency and 
seriousness of the situation.  
2. Upon m aking the  decision to begin the Analysis Phase, if the SIRT suspects that 
the Security Event may result in damage to the reputation of iCIMS or legal liability, 
the GCO shall initiate a legal assessment of actual or potential legal issues.   
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 12                           9.2. Analysis Phase  
The initial response to detection of a Security Event is typically the Analysis Phase. In this 
phase the SIRT determines whether or not a Security Event is an actual Security Incident.   To 
determine if a Security Event is a Security Inc ident the following considerations apply : 
1. Leverage diagnostic data to analyze the Security Event using tools directly on the 
operating system or application .  This may include , but not be limited to:  
(i) Taking screenshots, memory dumps, consult logs and network traces;  
(ii) Performin g analysis on the information being collected;  
(iii) Analyzing the precursors and indications;  
(iv) Looking for correlating information; and  
(v) Performing research (e.g., search engines, knowledgebase).  
 
2. Identify  whether the Security Event was the result of an innocent error, or the 
actions of a potential attacker.  If the latter, effort shall be made to identify who the 
potential attacker  may be, by :  
(i) Validating the attacker's IP address;  
(ii) Researching the attacker through search engines;  
(iii) Using incident databases;  
(iv) Monitoring attacker communication channels, if possible; and  
(v) In unique cases, and with the approval of legal counsel, potentially 
scanning the attacker's system.  
 
If the SIRT has determined that a Security Event has triggered a Security Incident, the 
appropriate SIRT team members will be engaged accordingly and the SIRT will begin 
documenting the investigation and gathering evidence.  The type of Security I ncident i s based 
on the nature of the event. Example types are listed as follows:  
1. Data exposure.  
2. Unauthorized access.  
3. Distributed Denial of Service/ Denial of Service (DDoS/DoS).  
4. Malicious code.  
5. Improper usage.  
6. Scans/Probes/Attempted access.  
If it is determined tha t a Security Incident has not been triggered, additional activities noted 
under ‘5.6.  Post-Incident Activities’ may be initiated under the direction of the SIRT.   
 
The Security Incident’s potential impact on iCIMS and/or its subscribers shall be evaluated 
and the SIRT shall assign an initial severity classification of low, medium, high or critical to 
the Security Incident.  To analyze the situation, scope, and impact, the SIRT shall: 
1. Define and confirm the severity level and potential impact of the Security  Incident.  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 13                           2. Identify which resources have been affected and forecast which resources will be 
affected.  
3. Estimate the current and potential effect of the Security Incident.  
 
The SIRT shall attempt to determine the scope of the Security Incident and verify if the 
Security Incident is still ongoing. Scoping the Security Incident may include collecting forensic 
data from suspect systems or gathering evidence that will support the investigation. It may 
also include identifying any potential data theft or destructi on. New investigative leads may be 
generated as the collected data is analyzed.  If the Security Incident involves malware, the 
SIRT shall analyze the malware to determine its capabilities and potential impact to the 
environment. Based on the evidence revie wed, the SIRT will determine if the Security Incident 
requires reclassification as to its  severity  or cause (e.g., whether it was originally thought to 
be the action of a malicious actor but turned out to be an innocent error, or vice versa) .  
As indicated  above, a Security Incident may require evidence to be collected. The collection 
of such evidence shall be done  with due diligence and the following procedures shall apply : 
1. Gathering and handling of evidence (forensics) shall include:  
(i) Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, 
hostname, media access control (MAC) address, and IP address of a 
computer);  
(ii) Name, title, and phone number of everyone who collected or handled the 
evidence during the investigation ;  
(iii) Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence 
handling;  
(iv) Locations where the evidence was stored , and conditions of storage (e.g., 
locked spaces, surveilled spaces) ; and  
(v) Reasonable efforts to create two backups of the affected sys tem(s) using 
new, unused media — one is to be sealed as evidence and one is to be 
used as a source of additional backups.  
2. To ensure that evidence is not destroyed or removed, where any Personnel are 
suspected of being responsible for  a Security Incident, i CIMS shall, consistent with 
its procedures, use reasonable efforts to place monitoring and forensics agents 
and/or confiscate all computer/electronic assets that have been assigned to him  or 
her. 
(i) This task may be done surreptitiously, and should be completed  as quickly 
and in as non -intrusive a manner as possible.  
(ii) The SIRT should consider restricting access to the computers and attached 
peripherals (including remote access via modem, secure remote system 
access, etc.) pending the outcome of its exami nation.  
3. Where applicable, and depending upon the seriousness of the Security Incident, 
items and areas that should be secured and preserved in an “as was” condition 
include:  
(i) Work areas (including wastebaskets);  
(ii) Computer hardware (keyboard, mouse, monitor, CPU, etc.);  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 14                           (iii) Software;  
(iv) Storage media (disks, tapes, removable disk drives, CD ROMs, etc.);  
(v) Documentation (manuals, printouts, notebooks, notepads);  
(vi) Additional components as deemed relevant (printer, cables, etc.);  
(vii) In cases of damage, the computer system an d its surrounding area, as 
well as other data storage devices, should be preserved for the potential 
collection of evidence (e.g., fingerprinting);  
(viii) If the computer is “Off”, it should not be turned “On”. For a stand -alone 
computer system, if the computer is “On”, the Information Security and 
IT Departments are to be contacted.  
4. It is important to establish who was using the computer system at the time of the 
Security Incident and/or who was in the immediate area. The SIRT should obtain 
copies of applicable records (e.g., access logs, swipe card logs, closed circuit 
television (“CCTV”) recordings) as part of the investigation.  
5. Based on the severity level and the categorization of the Security Incident, the 
proper team or Personnel shall be notified and contac ted by the SIRT.  
6. Until the SIRT, with the approval of iCIMS management, makes the Security 
Incident known to other Personnel, the foregoing activities shall be kept 
confidential to the extent possible.  
If it is determined that a Security Incident has occur red and may have a significant impact on 
iCIMS or its subscribers, the SIRT shall determine whether additional resources are required 
to investigate and respond to the Security Incident. The extent of the additional resources will 
vary depending on the nat ure and significance of the Security Incident.  
 
Abnormal Activities Notification:  
The SIRT recognizes that there may be many attempts to gain unauthorized access to, disrupt 
or misuse information systems and the information stored on them, and that many o f these 
attempts will be thwarted by iCIMS’ information security program.  In general, the SIRT will not 
report unsuccessful attacks to customers. For example, the SIRT would generally not be 
required to report to a Data Controller or customer if it makes a  good faith judgment that the 
unsuccessful attack was of a routine nature.  
 
However, the SIRT will take reasonable steps to notify customers or Data Controllers of any 
identified Abnormal Activities. For example, in making a judgment as to whether a partic ular 
unsuccessful attack should be reported, iCIMS might consider whether handling the attack 
required measures or resources well beyond those ordinarily used, like exceptional attention 
by senior personnel or the adoption of extraordinary non -routine prec autionary steps.  In cases 
of identified Abnormal Activities, the Data Controller or customer would be notified by means 
agreed upon by iCIMS and the Data Controller or customer within twenty -four (24) hours upon 
iCIMS becoming aware of the Abnormal Activi ty. 
 
Data Breach Notification:  
 
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 15                           If it is determined during the analysis phase that a Security Incident has occurred that 
constitutes a Data Breach, with notification obligations based on regulatory, legal, or similar 
requirements, notification of such Data  Breach shall be provided to the impacted Data 
Controller by email, telephone, or other means agreed upon by iCIMS and the Data Controller, 
within twenty -four (24) hours upon iCIMS becoming aware of the Data Breach.   Additional 
activities noted under ‘5.6.  Post-Incident Activities’ may also be initiated under the direction 
of the SIRT.   
 
 
9.3. Containment Phase  
The Containment Phase mitigates the root cause of the Security Incident to prevent further 
damage or exposure.  This phase attempts to limit the impact o f a Security Incident prior to 
an eradication and recovery event. During this phase, the SIRT may implement controls, as 
necessary, to limit the damage from a Security Incident.  If a Security Incident is determined 
to be caused by innocent error, the erad ication phase may not be needed.  For example, after 
reviewing any information that has been collected investigating the Security Incident the SIRT 
may:  
1. Secure the physical and network perimeter.  
i. For example, shutting down a system, disconnecting it from the network, 
and/or disabling certain functions or services.  
2. Connect through a trusted connection and retrieve any volatile data from the 
affected system.  
3. Determine the relative integrity and the appropriateness of backing the system up.  
4. If appropriate, b ack up the impacted system.  
5. Change the password(s) to the affected system(s). Personnel, as appropriate, 
shall be notified of the password change.  
6. Determine whether it is safe to continue operations with the affected system(s).  
i. If it is safe, allow the system to continue to function, in which case the SIRT 
will:  
a. Update the Incident Record accordingly; and   
b. Move to the Recovery Phase.  
ii. If it is not safe to allow the system to continue operations, the SIRT will 
discontinue the sys tem(s) operation and move to Eradication Phase.   
iii. The SIRT may permit continued operation of the system under close 
supervision and monitoring if:  
1. Such activity will assist in identifying individuals responsible for the 
Security Incident;  
2. The system can r un normally without risk of disruption, compromise 
of data, or serious damage; and  
3. Consensus has been reached within the SIRT before taking the 
supervision and monitoring approach.  
7. The final status of this stage should be appropriately documented in the 
Incident Record.  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 16                           8. The SIRT shall apprise senior management of the progress, as appropriate . 
 
During the Analysis and Containment Phases, the SIRT shall keep notes and use appropriate 
chain of custody procedures to ensure that the evidence gathered during the Security Incident 
can be used successfully during prosecution, if appropriate.  
  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 17                           9.4. Eradication Phase  
The Eradication Phase is the phase where vulnerabilities causing the Security Incident, and 
any associated compromises, are removed from the environment.  An effective eradication 
for a targeted attack removes the attacker’s access to the environment all a t once, during a 
coordinated containment and eradication event. Although the specific actions taken during the 
Eradication Phase can vary depending on the Security Incident, the standard process for the 
Eradication Phase shall be  as follows:   
1. Determine th e symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s).  
2. Eliminate components of the Security Incident. This may include deleting malware, 
disabling breached user accounts, etc.  
3. Strengthen the controls surrounding the affected system(s), where possible (a risk 
assessment will be performed, if needed). This may include the following:  
i. Strengthening network perimeter defenses.  
ii. Improving monitoring capabilities or scope.  
iii. Remediating any security issues within the affected system(s), such as 
removing unused serv ices or implementing general host hardening 
techniques.  
iv. Conduct a vulnerability assessment to verify that all the holes/gaps that can 
be exploited have been addressed.   
4. If additional issues or symptoms are identified, take appropriate preventative 
measure s to eliminate or minimize potential future compromises.  
5. Update the Incident Record with the information learned from the vulnerability 
assessment, including the cause, symptoms, and method used to fix the problem 
with the affected system(s).  
6. If necessary,  escalate to higher levels of support to enhance capabilities, 
resources, or time -to-eradication.  
7. Apprise senior management of progress, as appropriate . 
 
After iCIMS has implemented the changes for eradication, it is important to verify  that cause of 
and individual(s) causing  the Security Incident is fully eradicated from the environment.  The 
SIRT shall also  test the effectiveness of any security controls or changes that were made to the 
environment during containment and eradication.  
  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 18                           9.5. Reco very Phase  
The Recovery Phase represents the SIRT’s effort to restore the affected system(s) to 
operation after the problems that gave rise to the Security Incident, and the consequences of 
the Security Incident,  have been corrected.  Recovery events can be complex depending on 
the Security Incident type and can require full project management plans to be effective.  
Although the specific actions taken during the Recovery Phase can vary depending on the 
identified Security Incident, the standard process to accomplish this shall be  as follows:  
1. Execution  of the following actions, as appropriate:  
• Installing patches.  
• Rebuilding systems.  
• Changing passwords.  
• Restoring systems from clean backups.  
• Replacing affected files with clean versions.  
2. Determination whether the affected system(s) has been changed in any way.  
a. If the system(s) has been changed, the system is restored to its proper, 
intended functioning (“last known good”).  
i. Once restored, the system functions are validated to verify that the 
system/process funct ions as intended. This may require the involvement of 
the business unit that owns the affected system(s).  
ii. If operation of the system(s) had been interrupted (i.e., the system(s) had 
been taken offline), it should be restored and validated, and the system(s ) 
should be monitored for proper behavior.  
b. If the system(s) has not been changed in any way, but was taken offline (i.e., 
operations had been interrupted), restart the system and monitor for proper 
behavior.  
3. Implementation of additional monitoring and aler ting may be done  to identify similar 
activities.  
4. Update the Incident Record with any details determined to be relevant during this 
phase.  
5. Apprise senior management of progress, as appropriate . 
 
 
  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 19                           9.6. Post -Incident Activities  
In addition to the Data Breach an d Abnormal Activities notification requirements identified in 
the analysis phase above, and after verification of a successful containment and any 
necessary eradication, the SIRT shall take the following post -incident activities, as may be 
necessary:  
I. Communications  
A. Notification  
When warranted or required by judicial action, law, or regulation, iCIMS shall use 
reasonable efforts to provide notice to Personnel and/or affected parties about a 
Security Incident involving the Sensitive and/or Confidential I nformation of such 
stakeholders. For example:  
1. Where it has been determined, or the SIRT and management reasonably 
believe, that there has been unauthorized access to or release of unencrypted 
customer data;  
2. Where the Security Incident has compromised the security, confidentiality or 
integrity of Confidential Information.  
 
Upon deciding to notify  the SIRT, in consultation with senior management , shall 
use reasonable efforts to provide notice and disclosure to Personnel and/or 
affected parties within twenty -four (24) hours and, subject to applicable law, prior 
to notification of law enforcement personnel. Delay may nonetheless occur in 
instances where it is mandated or authorized by applicable law. For example, 
disclosure might be delayed if notice would impe de a criminal investigation or if 
time is required to restore reasonable integrity to iCIMS's  information systems.  
 
If appropriate, the SIRT may:  
1. Prepare a general notice and arrange for providing  the notice to Personnel 
and/or affected parties;  
2. Prepare a FAQ based on the notice and arrange to have it posted to the iCIMS 
website after the notice has been sent;  
3. Identify a point a contact for Personnel and/or affected parties to contact if 
further information is sought; and  
4. Establish a toll -free number for us e by stakeholders.  
 
iCIMS’s objective is to provide notice in a manner designed to ensure that 
Personnel and/or affected parties can reasonably be expected to receive the 
disclosure.  
The form  and content of the  of notification may either be by letter (firs t class mail) 
or by email sent to an address where Personnel and/or affected parties can 
reasonably be expected to receive the disclosure  or other, similar means . 
The notification, in clear and plain language, may contain the following elements:  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 20                           1. A description of the Security Incident that includes as much detail as is 
appropriate under the circumstances;  
2. The type of information subject to unauthorized access;  
3. Measures taken by iCIMS to protect the Information of Personnel and/or 
affected parties fro m further unauthorized access;  
4. A contact name and toll -free number that Personnel and/or affected parties 
may use to obtain further information;  
5. A reference to the page on the iCIMS website where updates may be obtained;  
6. A reminder to guard against possibl e identify theft by being vigilant with respect 
to banking or credit activity for twelve to twenty -four months;  
7. Contact information for national credit reporting agencies;  
8. Other elements as may be required by applicable law or whose inclusion the 
SIRT may  otherwise consider appropriate under the circumstances.  
 
B. Cooperation with External Investigators  
In the event that the SIRT considers it appropriate to inform law enforcement 
authorities or to retain forensic investigators or other external advisors, the 
following information shall be collected to provide to such authorities or 
investigators:  
1. To the extent known, details of the:  
a. Security Incident ( date, time, place, duration, etc.);  
b. Person(s) under suspicion (name, date of birth, address, 
occupation/positi on, employment contracts, etc.);  
c. Computer and network log files pertaining to the Security I ncident(s);  
d. “Ownership” details of any Information that is allegedly stolen, altered, 
or destroyed;  
e. The access rights to the computer system involved of the person(s) 
under investigation;  
f. Information obtained from access control systems (e.g., computer 
logs, CCTV, swipe card systems, attendance logs, etc.); and  
g. Any action taken by the IT department in relation to the computer 
systems concerned, including the d ate and time.  
2. A copy of applicable  iCIMS Data Privacy and Security Policy (“Policy”) in force 
at the time of the incident (if applicable); and  
3. Any other documentation or evidence relevant to the internal investigation of 
the Security Incident.  
 
C. Information  Sharing and Media Relations  
Security Incident -specific information (e.g., dates, accounts, programs, systems) 
must not be provided to any unknown individuals making such requests by 
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 21                           telephone or email. Any release of Security Incident -specific information  should 
only be to individuals previously identified by the SIRT. All requests for information 
from unknown individuals should be forwarded to the SIRT. If there is any doubt 
about whether information can be released, contact the GCO.  
Contact with law enfo rcement authorities shall only be made by the GCO in 
consultations with the SIRT and senior management.  
In the event of a Security Incident, where  members of the media make inquiries, 
Personnel are to be made aware that all requests for the release of info rmation, 
press releases, or media interviews must be submitted to the GCO.  
The GCO, in consultation with the SIRT and senior management, shall determine 
whether it is appropriate to issue a media statement, hold a press briefing, or 
schedule interviews.  
If Sensitive and/or Confidential Information has been compromised and a 
significant number of individuals, as identified by the SIRT, are affected and/or 
suspected of being affected, the GCO, upon consultation with outside counsel and 
subject to applicable law, shall use reasonable efforts to contact applicable 
consumer reporting agencies prior to sending notices to the affected Personnel 
and/or affected parties.  
Certain jurisdictions where iCIMS does business, or where iCIMS’s stakeholders 
reside, mandate d ifferent disclosure  or notification  obligations. Additionally, a dvice 
from both inside and outside counsel is required before communication occurs with 
credit reporting agencies.  
 
D. External Incident Communications  
After a Security Incident, information may be required to be shared with outside 
parties, following emergency response procedures as necessary, including:  
• Law enforcement/incident reporting organizations  
• Affected external parties  
• The media  
• Other outside p arties  
1. iCIMS will seek to ensure its obligations are fulfilled  by quickly and 
professionally taking control of communication early during major events. 
Accordingly, the SIRT will:   
• Designate a credible, trained, informed spokesperson to address the 
media;  
• Determine appropriate clearance and approval processes for the 
media;  
• Ensure the organization is accessible by media so they do not resort to 
other (less credible) sources for information;  
• Emphasize steps being taken to address the Security Incident ; 
• Tell the story quickl y, openly, and honestly to counter falsehoods,  
rumors, or undue suspicion.  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 22                           2. When publicly disclosing information of a Security Incident, the following 
should be considered:  
• Was Personal Information compromised?  
• Was subscriber  data compromised?  
• Were legal and /or contractual obligations invoked by the Security 
Incident?  
• What is the organization’s strategy moving forward?  
 
E. Internal Incident Communications  
1. Where warranted, the SIRT will ensure that open communication is maintained 
within the organization to ensure relevant parties are informed of facts, 
reminded of responsibilities, and capable of dismissing rumors and 
speculation.  
2. Aggregate documentation f rom post -mortem/follow -up reviews into the 
Security Incident record and create a formal report of the Security I ncident to 
share with senior management, as necessary.   
 
II. Follow Up  
The Follow -up Phase represents the review of the Security Incident to look f or 
“lessons learned” and to determine whether the process that was followed could 
have been improved in any way. Security Events and Security Incidents should be 
reviewed after identification resolution to determine where response could be 
improved.  
The SIRT will meet to review the Security Event or Security Incident record 
created, as necessary, and perform the following:  
i) Determine the root cause of the Security Incident and what should be done 
to ensure that the root cause has been addressed  
ii) Create a “lessons learned” document and include it with the Incident 
Record.  
iii) Evaluate the cost and impact of the Security Event or Incident to the 
organization using applicable documents and any other resources.  
iv) Determine what could be improved.  
v) Communicate these  findings to senior management for approval, as 
necessary, and for implementation of any recommendations made post -
review of the Security  Event or  Incident.  
vi) Carry out recommendations approved by senior management while 
ensuring that sufficient time and res ources are committed to this activity.  
vii) Close the Security  Event or  Incident.  
 
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 23                           A. Retention and Review of Security Incident Record & Documentation  
It shall be the responsibility of the SIRT to investigate the Security Incident and 
establish a n incident  record.  The incident record should be verified during the 
follow up process to ensure that it documents:  
1. Relevant factual information or evidence;  
2. Consultations with Personnel and external advisors; and  
3. Findings resulting from the collection of factual information or evidence 
obtained.  
 
The rationale for the creation of a n incident  record is that law enforcement 
authorities may be informed of Security Incidents or iCIMS may take legal action if 
individuals causing a Security Incident can be identified. T he implications of each 
Security Incident are not always discernible at the start of, or even during, the 
course of a Security Incident. Accordingly, it is important that information is 
documented and associated information system events are logged.  
The incident r ecord may be in written or electronic form. If it is maintained in an 
electronic form, appropriate protections must be applied to guard against the 
alteration or deletion of the incident r ecord.  
The information to be reported will vary according to  the specific circumstances 
and availability of the information, but may include:  
1. Dates and times when incident -related events occurred;  
2. Dates and times when incident -related events were discovered;  
3. Dates and times of incident -related conference calls;  
4. A description of the Security Incident, including the systems, programs, 
networks or types of Information that may have been compromised;  
5. Root c ause(s) of the Security Incident(s), if known , and how they have been 
addressed ; 
6. An estimate of the amount of time  spent by Personnel working to remediate 
incident -related tasks;  
7. The amount of time spent by Third Parties working on incident -related tasks, 
including advice from outside counsel;  
8. The names and contact information of all individuals providing information in 
connection with the investigation;  
9. Measures taken to prevent future Security I ncidents , taking into consideration 
root causes , along with any remediation costs incurred by iCIMS; and  
10. If applicable, the date and time of law enforcement involvement.  
 
All Personnel have an affirmative obligation to use reasonable efforts to respond 
to all inquiries for information and cooperate in all investigations.  
Incident Response Policy & Procedures   Policy Document  
  Page  | 24                           Review of the incident record and documentation should include the following:  
1. Review tracked documents of th e Security I ncident to evaluate the following:  
• The causes of the nonconformity;  
• Whether similar nonconformities exist or could potentially occur;  
• The effectiveness of the corrective action taken; and  
• The effectiveness of the Incident Response process.  
2. Learn from Security Incidents and improve the response process. Security 
Incidents must be recorded and a post incident review conducted. Identify the 
impact of Security Incidents and outline pain points for future security 
investments. The following details must be retained:  
• Types of Security Incidents  
• Volumes of Security Incidents and malfunctions  
• Costs incurred during the Security Incidents , where possible.  
 
B. Periodic Evaluation of the Program  
The processes surrounding incident response shall be peri odically reviewed and 
evaluated for effectiveness. This also involves appropriate training of resources 
expected to respond to Security Events and Incidents, as well as the training of the 
general population regarding the organization’s expectation of them , relative to 
security responsibilities.  
Security Events and Incidents shall be recorded  for tracking, analysis, and 
reporting purposes. The following metrics should be considered to assess the 
overall Security Incident management program:  
• Overall reductio n in time spent responding to Security Incidents.  
• Reduction of impact of certain Security Incidents.  
• Overall reduction of the occurrence of Security Incidents.  
• Mean time to analysis (MttA)  
• Mean time to resolution (MttR)
