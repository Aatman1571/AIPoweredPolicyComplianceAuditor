GUIDE 
GDPRSECURITY OF 
PERSONAL DATA 
Version 2024

The objective of this guide is to support organisations 
in the implementation of security measures in order to 
ensure the protection ofpersonal data that they treat.
It is aimed in particular at data protection 
officers (DPO), chief information security officer (CISO) 
and computer scientists. Privacy lawyers will also be 
able to find useful elements.
This guide is a living tool that is enriched by state-of-
the-art practices and doctrine elements of the French 
data protection authority (CNIL) on the issue of data 
security.
A changelog is available on the CNIL website to help 
actors identify the evolutions that need to be taken 
into account in order to adapt their level of security.

FOREWORD
Security is an essential part of the protection of personal data. It is binding on any data controller and 
data processor through Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation1  (GDPR). In principle, 
each processing operation must be subjected to a set of security measures decided according to the 
context, namely “useful precautions, having regard to the nature of the data and the risks presented 
by the processing” ( Article 121 of the French Data Protection Act2 ). The GDPR specifies that the 
protection of personal data requires taking “appropriate technical and organisational measures to 
ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk” for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, 
including their privacy.
To assess the measures to be put in place, two complementary approaches are to be deployed:
 –the establishment of a security base incorporating good practices resulting from years of      
capitalising on hygiene and IT security (e.g.: regulations, standards, guides). This base aims to 
address the most common risks;
 –the risk analysis3  for the persons concerned by the processing, which aims to identify and assess 
the risks specific to the treatment. Such an analysis supports objective decision-making on the 
treatment of these risks and the identification of necessary and context-appropriate measures.
However, it is difficult for non-specialists in IT security to implement such an approach and to ensure 
that the level of security of the processing for which they are responsible is sufficient.
To help with compliance, this guide presents a set of recommendations grouped by thematic 
factsheets. Each factsheet is structured in three sections:
 –basic precautions, which incorporate essential good practices;
 –bad trend practices, which should be avoided;
 –additional measures, to go further4 .
Each factsheet can be read separately from the others: references are given when another factsheet. 
1 “The General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR”, eur-lex.europa.eu
2 “La loi Informatique et Libertés”, cnil.fr
3 In particular, it is essential when the processing has to be subject to a data protection impact assessment or DPIA (see “Ce qu’il faut 
savoir sur l’analyse d’impact relative à la protection des données (AIPD)”, cnil.fr).
4 These measures may over time and practice become basic precautions.
5FACTSHEET 1 – MANAGING DATA SECURITY
Implement and maintain the protection of personal data required by the GDPR 
and sectoral frameworks.
The integration of data protection into the decision-making processes of the organisation ensures 
that it is taken into account over time and at key moments when budgets and projects are decided.
Basic precautions
• Involve the management and formalise general objectives in terms of security and protection of 
personal data, approved by the organisation’s management.
• Identify (through the register5) the processing of personal data, whether automated or not, the data 
processed (e.g.: customer files, contracts) and the media on which they rely:
 –the hardware (e.g.: servers, laptops, hard drives);
 –the software (e.g.: operating systems, business software);
 –the cloud computing resources used (e.g.: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS);
 –the logical or physical communication channels (e.g.: wired connections, Wi-Fi, Internet, verbal 
exchanges, couriers);
 –the paper documents (e.g.: printed documents, photocopies);
 –the physical premises and facilities where the above-mentioned elements are located (e.g.: IT 
rooms, offices).
Formalise interconnecting and data flow diagrams between the different components of information 
systems. The register and diagrams must be updated whenever there is structural change to the 
processing or components of the information systems.
• Define an IT security action plan and implement the technical and organisational measures defined  
to ensure data protection. To this end, two complementary approaches can be implemented: on the 
one hand, implementing the basic precautions listed in this guide (see the assessment checklist) and, 
on the other hand, supplementing these with specific measures identified using risk analysis6  (see  
factsheet 20 – Risk analysis). 
Any new measures decided must incorporate the action plan, the progress of which is monitored on 
a regular basis.
• Periodically check the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures to ensure that they are 
achieving their intended purpose (e.g. by setting up indicators). Prioritise the measures implemented 
to address identified vulnerabilities or to prevent incidents that have already occurred.
• Ensure that management is kept informed of IT risk management through a management review at 
least once a year. It should enable decision to be taken and summary to be produced a summary to 
be produced and decisions to be taken bearing in mind:
 –the changing context, challenges and expectations of stakeholders (e.g.: customers, partners, 
supervisory authorities);
 –the changing objectives and missions of the organisation;
 –the evolution of cyber threats;
 –the development of new security technologies or solutions;
 5 “Le registre des activités de traitement”, cnil.fr
 6 Article 35 of the GDPR requires a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for certain types of processing (see “Ce qu’il faut savoir 
sur l’analyse d’impact relative à la protection des données (AIPD)”, cnil.fr).
6
 –the evolving nature of information systems and data processing;
 –the evolution of data security and privacy risks;
 –the progress made on the legal action plan (e.g.: compliance of contracts) and the technical 
action plan (security measures);
 –the incidents and breaches encountered, with their impact on the organisation and the data     
subject;
 –the requests and complaints received and processed concerning personal data.
• Improve the protection of personal data over time. In particular, the management review should 
make it possible to decide on the allocation of the human and budgetary resources needed for the 
measures to be put in place and for the continuous improvement of security.
What should be avoided
• Considering security as an afterthought that can be dealt with at a later stage, once data processing 
is already operational.
• Focusing on advanced measures without having in place the basic precautions.
• Being limited to one-off actions and not considering data processing as a whole (e.g. data collection, 
partners, end-of-life) when deciding on security measures to be put in place.
• Relying solely on technical measures without backing them up with coherent organisational 
measures.
• Defining an action plan without assigning a deadline and responsible for implementation to each 
action.
• Delegating the management of all IT security to a provider.
7  TO GO FURTHER
• For day-to-day monitoring of security and data protection, it is very useful (or even mandatory 
depending on the nature of the organisation) to appoint a chief information security officer (CISO) 
and a data protection officer7 (DPO). They must:
 –be qualified to report directly to the highest level of management;
 –have the necessary resources and working conditions to carry out their duties;
 –be involved (themselves own or their team) systematically and at an early stage in the discussions 
on issues relating to their area of responsibilities, in order to ensure that information systems are 
secured and the personal data are protected by design and by default.
• The general objectives for the protection of personal data can be recorded in a general data 
protection policy, endorsed by management and communicated to all those involved (staff, 
subcontractors, partners). This policy can then be specified at an operational level in the form of 
thematic policies and detailed procedures to adapt the measures for the protection of personal data 
to the context of the organisation’s activities.
• Security audits are an essential means of assessing the level of security of the systems on which the 
processing of personal data is based. Carried out periodically, they allow taking changes in processing 
and threats into account. Each audit must produce an action plan, the implementation of which 
should be monitored at the highest level of the organisation.
• In order to structure governance over time, it is possible to set up a management system based 
on a continuous improvement approach. The International Standard ISO/IEC 277018  describes 
the organisational and technical processes and measures to implement a Privacy Information 
Management System (PIMS), based on the Information Security Management System (ISMS) covered 
by Standard ISO/IEC 27001.
• The French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) has published its own guide9  on best practices 
in IT security.

USERS 
9FACTSHEET 2 – DEFINING A FRAMEWORK FOR USERS
Give binding force to the main rules for the use of IT tools.
Users often have daily use of the IT tools. Their practices can have a direct impact on the security of 
personal data and therefore need to be framed.
Basic precautions
• Draft an IT charter and give it binding force (e.g.: annexation to the Rules of Procedure).
• Include in the charter at least the following:
1. A reminder of the rules of data protection and of the sanctions incurred for non-compliance with 
these rules.
2. The scope of the application of the charter, which should include in particular:
 –the methods of intervention of the teams responsible for managing the organisation’s IT resources;
 –the authentication methods used by the organisation and the password policy that the user 
 –must respect;
 –the security rules that users must comply with including:
 –reporting to the internal IT department any suspected breach or attempt to breach its computer 
account, any loss or theft of equipment and, in general, any malfunction;
 –never entrusting your password (or equivalent) to a third party;
 –never installing, copying, modifying, destroying or configuring software without permission;
 –locking (or turning off) your computer as soon as you leave your workstation;
 –not accessing, attempting to access or delete information if this is not the responsibility of the 
user;
 –respecting the procedures previously defined by the organisation in order to regulate the 
operations of copying data on removable media, in particular by obtaining the prior approval of 
the hierarchical superior and by complying with the security rules.
3. The procedures for the use of IT equipment and telecommunications resources made available such 
as:
 –workstations;
 –mobile equipment (especially in the context of teleworking);
 –individual storage spaces;
 –local networks;
 –personal devices (especially the conditions to use such devices);
 –the Internet;
 –electronic messaging;
 –telephony.
4. The conditions governing the administration of the information system, and the existence, where 
applicable, of:
 –automatic filtering systems;
 –automatic logging systems;
 –workstation management systems.
5. The responsibilities and sanctions incurred in the event of non-compliance with the charter.

Example of a confidentiality commitment clause for individuals who are intended to 
manipulate personal data
I, the undersigned Mr/Mrs. exercising the functions of_________________________________________ within the 
company_______________________(hereinafter referred to as “the Company”), being therefore required to access personal 
data, declares that I recognise the confidentiality of such data.
I therefore undertake, in accordance with Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation of 27 April 2016, to take all 
precautions in accordance with the state of the art and internal rules within the framework of my powers in order to protect 
the confidentiality of the information to which I have access, and in particular to prevent it from being communicated to 
persons not expressly authorised to receive such information.
In particular, I undertake to:
- not to use the data that I can access for purposes other than those provided for by my powers;
- disclose this data only to persons duly authorised, by reason of their functions, to receive such information, whether 
private, public, natural or legal;
- not to make any copies of this data except as necessary for the performance of my duties;
- take all measures consistent with the state of the art and internal rules within the framework of my powers in order 
to avoid the misuse or fraudulent use of this data;
- take all precautions in accordance with the state of the art and internal rules to preserve the physical and logical 
security of this data;
- ensure, within my powers, that only secure means of communication will be used to transfer this data;
- in the event of termination of my duties, return in full the data, computer files and any information media relating 
to these data.
This confidentiality commitment, in force for the duration of my duties, will remain effective, after the termination of my 
duties, whatever the cause and until the data has been made public by the Company, provided that this commitment 
concerns the use and communication of personal data.
I have been informed that any breach of this undertaking exposes me to disciplinary and criminal sanctions in accordance 
with the regulations in force, in particular with regard to Articles 226-13 and 226-16 to 226-24 of the Criminal Code.

Signature:
   What should be avoided
• Not giving binding force to the charter or not applying and enforcing it in case of non-compliance.
• Not considering the real practices of users, their expectations and their needs by defining the 
rules for the use of IT means: shadow IT sometimes reveals essential needs that are not met by the 
organisation or a structural malfunction.
• Not supporting users in their practices.
• Provide for the signature of a confidentiality commitment (see example clause below), or 
include in employment contracts a specific confidentiality clause concerning personal data.
• Provide for a specific charter for administrators which details the additional requirements that 
this particularly at-risk population must comply with.
11FACTSHEET 3 – INVOLVING AND TRAINING USERS
Make each user aware of privacy and security challenges.
Human errors and social engineering attacks are responsible for a significant number of security 
incidents. Technical solutions are not sufficient to ensure the protection of personal data held by 
organisations.
Basic precautions
• Raise awareness among users (both internal and external to the organisation) working with personal 
data about the privacy risks, informing them of the measures implemented to address these risks and 
the potential consequences in case of non-compliance. Concretely, it can be:
 –organise awareness sessions on risks, the main types of attacks (e.g.: phishing, ransomware, 
identity theft), the necessary vigilance (e.g.: before opening an attachment or clicking on a link 
in a message, when answering the phone), and what to do in the event of an incident or suspicion 
(protection and warning measures);
 –regularly send instructions reminders according to the current events of the organisation (e.g.: 
recent phishing attempt, arrival of a new provider).
• Deploy different awareness campaigns whose content and language are adapted to the roles of the 
recipients. For example, human resources staff need to be made aware of the data they handle, and 
the employees who woks off-site need to be made aware of the specific risks of nomadism.
• Ensure that staff in charge of processing personal data (e.g.: those in charge of handling complaints 
or administrative documents) have fully assimilated good practices relating to the protection of 
personal data to be implemented on a daily basis (e.g.: knowledge assessment).
• Train staff in charge of IT tools (e.g.: those in charge of design and maintenance) in IT security and 
protection of personal data.
• Document the operating procedures, keep them up to date and make them available to all users 
concerned. In concrete terms, any action on personal data, whether it is an administration-related 
operations or plain use of an application, must be explained in clear language adapted to each 
category, in documents to which the users can refer.
What should be avoided
• Imposing IT tools without accompanying their adoption by the teams.
• Not making it mandatory for new recruits to attend to session on the protection of personal data, 
when the organisation’s main activity involve processing of personal data (e.g.: health facility, 
customer service).
• Underestimating the positive impact that well-informed employees can have on the organisation’s 
IT security.
• Not ensuring the awareness of external service providers (by direct action or by contractual 
commitment) when their impact on data security can be just as significant as that of internal 
employees.
12
TO GO FURTHER
10 Sensitive data are described in Article 6 of the French Data Protection and Freedoms Act and Article 9 of the GDPR.• Implement an information classification policy and tools defining several levels (e.g.: public, 
internal, confidential) and requiring to mark the documents, media and e-mails containing 
confidential data.
• Place a visible and explicit notice on each page of paper or electronic documents which contain 
sensitive data10 .
• Organise exercises and simulations of IT security incidents or crises (with the prior organisation 
and supervision required for any security exercise). These exercises enable to review how well 
the instructions have been applied and the effectiveness of incident and crisis management 
procedures in place. Consolidating the feedback from these exercises enable to identify the 
messages to be strengthened and the procedures to be improved. 
1311  Behavioral biometrics (e.g.: keystroke dynamics) is less mature than physiological biometrics (e.g.: fingerprint scans).
12  For workplace authentication , any controller wishing to carry out such processing must comply with the requirements of the 
regulatory framework on access by biometric authentication in the workplace (see “Le contrôle d’accès sur les lieux de travail”, cnil.fr).
13  “Mots de passe : une nouvelle recommandation pour maîtriser sa sécurité ”, cnil.fr
14   Entropy, applied to a password, corresponds to its ability to resist a brute force attack.  
For example, for the secret code of a credit card, the number of possible combinations is equal to 10 (possible figures) to the power 
4 (104). In binary, to obtain an equivalent number of combinations, it is necessary to use 13 bits, because 2 (possible bits) at the 
power 13 (213) is worth 8192, which is of the same order of magnitude as 10 4. This gives an entropy of 13 bits.FACTSHEET 4 – AUTHENTICATING USERS
Recognising users so that they can be given the necessary accesses.
Before any use of IT ressources, a user must be given an identifier of his own and must authenticate 
himself so that his identity and accesses to the data he needs can be checked.
The mechanisms for carrying out the authentication of persons are categorised according to whether 
they involve:
 –a knowledge factor (what one knows), e.g. a password;
 –a possession factor (what one has), for example a smart card;
 –an inherent factor (what one is), for example a fingerprint or keystroke dynamics11 . As a reminder, 
the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person on the 
basis of his physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics is a processing of sensitive data 
which gives rise to the application of Article 9 of the GDPR 12.
User authentication is defined as multi-factor when it uses a combination of at least two factors 
of distinct categories. It is referred to as strong if it is based on a cryptographic mechanism whose 
parameters and security are considered robust (e.g.: cryptographic key).
Basic precautions
• Define a unique identifier per user and prohibit shared accounts between several users. In the event 
that using generic or shared identifiers is unavoidable, require a hierarchy validation, implement 
measures to log the actions associated with these identifiers and renew the password as soon as a 
person no longer needs to access the account.
• Respect the CNIL recommendation13  in the case of password-based user authentication, notably by 
applying the following rules:
 –store only the fingerprints of passwords, obtained using state-of-the-art techniques;
 –do not request a periodic renewal of passwords for simple users (unlike administrators);
 –when he or she first logs in, require the user to change any password attributed automatically or 
by an administrator when creating the account or resetting the password.;
 –impose password complexity according to the use cases:
 –by default, entropy14 (theoretical unpredictability) minimum of 80 bits (e.g.: Minimum 12 
characters with uppercases, lowercases, digits and special characters; Minimum 14 characters with 
uppercases, lowercases and digits, with no mandatory special character);
 –50-bit entropy (e.g.: Minimum 8 characters of 3 different types; 16 digits) in case additional 
measures are in place (restriction of access to the account such as delaying access after several 
failures, setting up “Captcha” or blocking the account after 10 failures);
 –13-bit entropy (e.g.: 4 digits) in the case of equipment owned by the user (e.g.: SIM card, device 
containing a certificate) with blocking after 3 failures.

16 “5 arguments pour adopter le gestionnaire de mots de passe”, cnil.fr
17  “‘Les conseils de la CNIL pour un bon mot de passe’”, cnil.fr• Support users in choosing a strong password:
 –by raising awareness of mnemonic methods15  ;
 –by encouraging the use of password managers16  and providing training in their use:
 –it enables to securely register as many passwords as necessary while requiring only one master 
password to be memorised;
 –the master password must therefore be particularly strong;
 –particular attention must be paid to the choice of solution.
• Communicate on prohibited practices17  (e.g.: communicating your password to anyone else, using 
a password that can be deduced from the context in which it is used, save passwords in a browser 
without a master password). In case of bad practices, a password respecting the required entropy can 
always be easily used by an attacker.
What should be avoided
• Using the default passwords of equipment and software.
• Storing passwords in clear text, not as a cryptographic fingerprint.
• Using an obsolete cryptographic hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1 (see factsheet 21 – Encryption, 
hash, signature) for generating the password footprint to be stored, or designed internally, which is 
therefore unrecognised or proven.
• Preventing the use of the “Paste” or auto-complete function in forms to avoid impacting the use of 
a password manager.
15TO GO FURTHER
• Favour multi-factor authentication whenever possible, especially when the connection is 
accessible from outside the organisation’s network.
• Limit the number of access attempts to user accounts on workstations and block access to the 
account temporarily or not, when its limit is reached.
• Require administrators to use higher entropy passwords and renew them on a reasonable and 
relevant frequency.
• Implement technical measures to enforce authentication rules (e.g.: blocking an administrator’s 
account if a password is not updated).
• On its website, the CNIL provides a tool18  for calculating the complexity of passwords requested 
from users, depending on each use case (password alone, with access restrictions or with material 
held by the person).
• If possible, avoid making the identifiers (or logins) of users and administrators the same as 
accounts defined by default by the software companies and deactivate default accounts.
• Store passwords securely, processed with a function (hash) specifically designed for this purpose 
and always using a salt or key19 (see factsheet 21 – Encryption, hash, signature). A key must not be 
stored in the same database as the fingerprints of the passwords.
• The ANSSI in collaboration with the CNIL20 , published recommendations on multi-factor 
authentication and passwords. Also refer to the guides21  published by the ANSSI to help developers 
and administrators in their choice of cryptographic algorithms, sizing and implementation.
• For administrative authorities, the Annexes to the “ référentiel général de sécurité ” (RGS22 ) apply, 
in particular annexes B1 and B2 concerning cryptographic mechanisms and key management, 
respectively. 
18 “Vérifier sa politique de mots de passe”, cnil.fr
19 The random used is called “salt” when it is different for each password stored and “key” when it is common to the transformation of 
a set of passwords (e.g. for a whole database).

TO GO FURTHERFACTSHEET 5 – ACCESS MANAGEMEMENT 
Only allow access to data that the user really needs.
Respecting the principle of least privilege, through the management of the authorisation profiles, 
allows to limit the consequences of an account usurpation or an error of manipulation.
Basic precautions
• Define authorisation profiles in systems by separating tasks and areas of responsibility, in order to 
restrict users’ access to only the data strictly necessary for fulfilling their responsibilities.
• Get all request for authorisation validated by a manager (e.g.: line manager, project manager).
• Withdraw users’ access right as soon as they are no longer authorised to access a room or an IT 
resource (e.g. change of mission or post) as well as at the end of their contract.
• Carry out a regular review, at least annually, of authorisations in order to identify and delete unused 
accounts and realign the rights granted to each user’s responsibilities. The business managers should 
be involved in this review so that they can ensure the operational legitimacy of the rights granted.
What should be avoided
• Creating or using accounts shared by several people without tracing these exceptions to the security 
rules, without having them validated by the appropriate managers and without regularly reviewing 
them.
• Granting administrator rights to users who do not need them.
• Granting a user more privileges than necessary.
• Forgetting to remove temporary authorisations granted to a user (e.g.: for a replacement).
• Forgetting to delete user accounts of people who have left the organisation or changed their 
functions.
• Establish, document and regularly review an access control policy in relation to the processing 
operations implemented by the organisation, which must include:
 –the procedures to be applied automatically upon arrival and departure or change of role for an 
individual with access to personal data;
 –the planned consequences for individuals with legitimate access to data in the event of non-
compliance with security measures (e.g.: misuse of a right of legitimate access);
 –the measures allowing to restrict and control the granting and use of access to processing (see 
factsheet 16 – Logging operations).

FACTSHEET 6 – SECURING WORKSTATIONS
Prevent fraudulent access, malicious programs execution
(e.g.: virus) or remote control, including via the Internet.
There is an abundance of IT intrusion risks and workstations embody one of the key entry points.
Basic precautions
• Provide an automatic session locking mechanism triggered whenever the workstation has not been 
in use for a given time.
• Install a firewall software on the station and restrict the opening of communication ports to those 
strictly necessary to the applications installed on the workstation for proper running.
• Use regularly updated antivirus.
• Patch security breaches with appropriated security updates as soon as possible after testing them. 
Updates patching publicly disclosed critical flaws must be installed with no delay.
• Keep users’ rights to the strict minimum based on their needs for their workstations’ use.
• Enable and promote the storage of users’ data on a regularly backed up online storage space 
accessible through the organisation’s internal network rather than on the actual workstations. If data 
is locally stored, provide synchronisation or backup means to users and train them to use them.
• Securely erase data on any workstation before reassigning it to another person.
• Regarding removable supports (e.g.: USB sticks, external hard drives):
 –raise the users’ awareness about removable devices’ associated risks, especially if they come 
from the outside;
 –restrict the connection of removable media to the strictly necessary;
 –disable “autorun” from removable media.
• For assistance on workstations:
 –remote administration tools must obtain consent from the user prior to any intervention on his/
her position (e.g.: whenever an appointment was agreed upon, by displaying a message to the user 
that they have to agree to);
 –the user must also be able to distinguish between whether the remote control is still in progress 
and whether it ended (e.g.: by displaying a message on the screen).
What should be avoided
• Using obsolete operating systems whose support is no longer provided by the publisher.
• Provide administration privileges, both locally and on the network, to users whose position does not 
requires it (e.g.: administrators).
19TO GO FURTHER
• Only allow the execution of applications downloaded from safe sources (white list).
• Restrict the use of applications requiring administrator rights for their execution.
• Provide a secure environment (e.g.: virtualised temporary environment) for carrying out 
necessary operations involving a particular risk (e.g.: navigation on an untrusted website).
• Set up a solution for analysing and decontaminating removable media before each use. ANSSI 
has published a guide23  to help choosing these types of solutions.
• Upon the compromise of a workstation, look for the source as well as any trace of intrusion into 
the organisation’s information system to detect the compromise of other elements.
• Monitor the software and hardware used in the organisation’s information system. CERT-FR, 
the French government centre for monitoring in charge of alerting and responding to computer 
attacks, issues on its website24  alerts and notices on vulnerabilities discovered in software and 
hardware. Whenever possible it also provides means to guard against them.
• Deploy critical updates to operating systems without delay (if applicable after testing them) by 
scheduling a weekly automatic check.
• Provide a functional updates policy.
• Fasten workstations to specific or difficult to move furniture (e.g.: use anti-theft cables).
• Make sure all users are well informed about the action to be taken and the list of persons to 
be contacted in the event of a security incident or an unusual event affecting the organisation’s 
information and communication systems.
• Consult25 the CERT-FR page on good reflexes in case of intrusion on an information system.

FACTSHEET 7 – SECURING MOBILE COMPUTING
Anticipate the breach of data security outside your premises, including theft or 
loss of mobile equipment.
A wide variety of remote work practices, outside the organisations’ premises, have risen (e.g.: travel, 
teleworking) as well as the use of personal equipment for work purposes resulting to specific risks 
increasement, specifically with the use of laptops, USB sticks or smartphones: supervising such risks 
is crucial.
Basic precautions
• Raise users’ awareness regarding specific risks associated with the use of mobile IT tools (e.g. 
equipment theft, connection to uncontrolled networks and equipment risks, in particular public 
equipment, use of personal equipment) and procedures to restrict them.
• Provide access control through appropriate authentication devices (e.g.: electronic certificate, smart 
card). All information flows should be encrypted (e.g. VPN for external access).
• Provide users with shared storage spaces that are remotely accessible. Encourage them to store all 
their data there in order to mitigate the damages caused by loss or theft of their devices.
• Implement or integrate an encryption solution for nomadic or removable storage devices (e.g.: 
laptop, USB drive, external hard drive, CD-R, DVD-RW) such as:
 –hard disk encryption (many operating systems support such a functionality);
 –file-by-file encryption;
 –encrypted containers creation (folder that can contain multiple files).
• Regarding smartphones, on top of the SIM card’s PIN use, enable the automatic locking of the 
terminal and require a secret to unlock it (e.g.: password, pattern).
• Make sure that users are given the proper contact details of the employee in charge in case of loss 
or theft of their devices.
• Assess and address the specific risks associated with personal equipment use by users (bring your 
own device or BYOD) and authorise them only regarding those identified risks. Such devices that are 
uncontrolled by the organisation shall be accordingly restricted in accessing data and application with 
regards with their criticality. Make sure that the IT charter covers and formalise the responsibilities 
of everyone involved as well as the precautions that have to be followed (see factsheet 2 – Defining 
a framework for users).
What should be avoided
• Using default cloud services installed by default on a device for backup or synchronization purposes 
without an in-depth analysis of their terms of use and security requirements complied by those 
services providers. These do not generally comply with the recommendations given in factsheet 14 – 
Managing data processors.
• Enforcing security measures (e.g.: by restrictively setting up a mobile device management system, 
MDM, on a personal phone) that prevent the domestic use of personal equipment on the grounds 
that the device is used in a professional context (e.g. prohibit the installation of applications on the 
device).
• Breaking the user’s privacy rights by accessing to data or elements stored in the user’s personal 
storage space of their device used in
• Accessing elements relating to the privacy of persons stored in the personal space of personal

26 “BYOD : quelles sont les bonnes pratiques ?”, cnil.fr
27 “Best Practices For Business Travellers”, cyber.gouv.frequipment used in the professional context (BYOD). 
• See the factsheet dedicated26  to the use of personal equipment by users on the CNIL website.
• Set up a mobile device management system (MDM), including on personal devices used in the 
professional context (BYOD) if the practice is allowed, in order to standardise configurations and 
control the security assurance level of devices that connect to the organisation’s network.
• Provide a privacy filter for workstations’ screens if they are to be used in public spaces.
• Raise awareness on bad practices in public places:
 –do not leave equipment or documents unattended;
 –do not discuss (e.g.: group chat, phone calls) or share sensitive information (e.g.: personal data, 
information that may reveal security breaches).
• Restrict local data storage on nomadic workstations to what is strictly necessary, in particular 
for personal equipment, and possibly prohibit it when travelling abroad27 .
• Protect yourself against theft (e.g.: safety cable, visible marking of equipment) and mitigate 
the impacts (e.g.: automatic locking, encryption, remote deletion). If a deletion mechanism is to 
be used on a personal device (BYOD), the employer must incorporate its terms of use into the IT 
charter (see factsheet 2 – Defining a framework for users).
• Partition parts of personal equipment intended to be used in a professional setting. 
22
FACTSHEET 8 – PROTECTING THE COMPUTER NETWORK
Confine network functions to the extent strictly necessary for the execution of 
your processing.
Internal network interconnects all components of an organisation’s information systems and often 
offers connection points with the outside. It is just as much an entry point as a medium for attacks 
propagation. Therefore, securing the internal network is critical.
Basic precautions
• Limit Internet access by blocking unnecessary services (e.g. VoIP, peer to peer).
• Manage Wi-Fi networks. They must use state-of-the-art encryption (WPA3 or WPA2 in accordance 
with ANSSI’s configuration recommendations28 ). Additionally, networks open to guests must be 
separated from the internal network.
• Enforce VPN use for remote access implementing, if possible, strong user authentication (e.g.: 
smart card, time-based one-time password (TOTP).
• Ensure that no administration interface is directly over the Internet. Operations for administration 
and maintenance must be carried out through a VPN.
• For network administration purposes, best practice is to (correctly) configure and implement 
the SSH protocol or physically access the equipment.
• Limit network flows to what is strictly necessary by filtering incoming/outgoing flows on 
equipment (e.g.: firewalls, proxy servers). For instance, if a web server is on a HTTPS-only mode, 
you should only allow incoming flows on that machine on port 443 and block all other ports.
• Partition the network to mitigate potential security breaches impacts. Implement at least two 
distinguished network areas: an internal network where no Internet connection is allowed and a 
DMZ (demilitarized zone) accessible from the Internet, separated by gateways.
What should be avoided
• Using the Telnet protocol for active network equipment connection (e.g.: firewalls, routers, 
gateways).
• Providing users with unfiltered Internet access.
• Setting up a Wi-Fi network using WEP encryption.

• Administration and maintenance operations should be carried out from equipment under the 
exclusive control of the data controller or its subcontractors.
• Automatic hardware identification can be implemented by configuring hardware authentication 
(802.1X protocol) or, at least, by defining an updated identifiers whitelist of network interface 
controllers (MAC addresses) to restrain an unlisted device connection.
• Intrusion Detection (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention (IPS) systems can analyse network traffic to 
detect and even respond to some attacks. Inform users of the implementation of such systems in 
the IT charter (see factsheet 2 – Defining a framework for users), after informing and consulting 
staff union representatives.
• ANSSI has published a good practices handbook29, to help decide for instance how to define 
the interface for connecting an information system to the Internet30  (which are inspired by the 
diagram below), the choice of firewalls31  or the deployment of the 802.1X protocol32 .

FACTSHEET 9 – SECURING SERVERS
Strengthen servers’ security measures.
Since servers centralise a great amount of data as well as host services allowing to access to or 
manipulate said data, server security shall be a priority.
Basic precautions
• Uninstall or disable unnecessary services and interfaces.
• Access to administration tools and interfaces shall be restricted to authorized personnel only. Use 
user accounts without privileges for routine operations.
• Adopt a specific password policy for administrators. Change passwords, at least, during each 
departure of an administrator and in case of suspicion of compromise.
• Install critical updates without delay (if applicable after testing them), in particular security patches, 
whether for operating systems or applications, by scheduling a weekly automatic check-up.
• Use malware detection and removal software (e.g.: antivirus), update them regularly.
• Use registered accounts for databases access and create application-specific technical accounts.
• Backup and regularly check backup files’ integrity and the possibility to restore them ( see factsheet 
17 – Saving).
• Implement the TLS protocol (instead of SSL33 ), or a protocol ensuring encryption and authentication, 
at least for any exchange of data on the Internet and check its proper implementation by appropriate 
tools34 .
• Do not allow the use of outdated encryption algorithms for server communications.
• Set up a logging event system ( see factsheet 16 – Logging operations).
What should be avoided
• Processing personal data on obsolete servers not replacing them.
• Using insecure data exchange protocols (e.g. unencrypted authentication, cleartext flows).
• Using servers for functions other than those they are dedicated to, such as browsing websites or 
accessing email.
• Placing databases on a server directly accessible from the Internet.
• Using generic accounts (i.e. shared between multiple users).
33 The TLS protocol is sometimes wrongly called SSL or SSL/TLS. The SSL protocol, the predecessor of TLS, is now obsolete and to 
be banned.
34 For TLS, there are several tools for this purpose (e.g.: “SSL Server T est”, ssllabs.com, “SSL-Tools”, ssl-tools.net).

42 “Recommandations pour la mise en place de cloisonnement système”, cyber.gouv.fr• Any system processing sensitive data35 must be implemented in a dedicated environment  
(logically isolated).
• Server administration operations should be carried out through a dedicated and isolated 
network, with strong authentication access (see factsheet 5 – Access management) for enhanced 
traceability (see factsheet 16 – Logging operations).
• In addition to external flows, internal flows shall be encrypted as much as possible (e.g. using 
TLS, IPsec or SSH protocols).
• Isolate obsolete but essential servers and limit the processing of personal data on it pending 
their replacement by up-to-date systems.
• As for software running on servers, use vulnerability detection tools (software of vulnerability 
scans such as nmap36,    nessus37  or nikto38 ) or rely on audits for the most critical processing 
to detect possible security vulnerabilities. Attacks detection and prevention systems on critical 
systems or servers can also be used.
• Restrict physical access and prohibit remote logical access to diagnosis and configuration 
ports.
• TLS v1.3 should be implemented and/or integrated or, at least, v1.2, in compliance to ANSSI’s 
published recommendations on the subject39 .
• ANSSI has published various40  recommendations, including securing the administration of 
information systems41  and setting up system partitioning42 . 
26
FACTSHEET 10 – SECURING WEBSITES
Ensure that minimum good practices are applied to websites.
Every website must guarantee its identity to the terminals connecting to it and the confidentiality 
of the information transmitted.
Basic precautions
• Secure data exchange flows through the use of TLS:
 –obtain certificates at the appropriate levels (domain, organisation or extended) from a certification 
authority and manage them appropriately;
 –implement the TLS (replacing SSL43 ) protocol on all websites, using only the latest versions and 
verifying its correct implementation;
 –make the use of TLS mandatory for all authentication pages or pages on which personal data are 
displayed or transmitted.
• Limit communication ports to those strictly necessary for the proper functioning of installed 
applications. If access to a web server is only via HTTPS, you should allow only incoming IP network 
traffic for that machine on port 443 and block all the other ports.
• Restrict access to administrative tools and interfaces to authorised personnel only. In particular, 
restrict the use of administrator accounts to internal IT teams, and only for administrative actions that 
require them.
• Implement the “HttpOnly” and “secure” options for all cookies used.
• If cookies that are not necessary for the service are used, collect the user’s consent after informing 
the user and before the cookie is stored.
• Limit the number of components used, monitor them regularly and update them.
• Limit the information returned when creating a user account or when resetting a password, in order 
not to inform an attacker about the existence – or not – of an account associated with an identifier 
(e.g. e-mail address).
• Adopt best practices for IT development (see factsheet 11 – Managing IT developments). In 
particular, guard against the most common attacks on websites referenced in the OWASP Top 1044   
(e.g.: SQL injections45 , XSS injections46 , URL manipulations47 ).
What should be avoided
• Transmitting personal data in a URL (e.g.: credentials, passwords).
• Using unsecured services (e.g.: unencrypted authentication, unencrypted flow).
• Using servers hosting websites as workstations (e.g.: browsing websites, e-mail access).
• Placing databases on a server directly accessible from the Internet.
• Using generic user accounts (i.e. shared between several users).
43 The TLS protocol is sometimes wrongly called SSL or SSL/TLS. The SSL protocol, the predecessor of TLS, is now obsolete and to 
be banned.
44 The Open web application security project (OWASP) regularly publishes a list of the ten most critical risks for web applications

OWASP. IFor49  software running on servers, it is advisable to use vulnerability detection tools 
(vulnerability scan software such as OWASP ZAP50, nmap51  or nikto52 ) for the most critical 
processing, in order to detect possible security flaws. Systems for detecting and preventing 
attacks on critical systems or servers can also be used. These tests must be carried out on a 
regular basis and before any new software version is put into production.
• The ANSSI has published specific recommendations on its website53  for implementing TLS54  
or securing a website55 .
28
FACTSHEET 11 – MANAGING IT DEVELOPMENTS
Integrate the security and protection of personal data as early as possible 
into projects.
The protection of personal data must be integrated into the IT development cycle right from the 
design phase and for default configurations in order to provide data subjects with better control over 
their data and to limit errors, losses, unauthorised changes, or misuse of their data in applications.
Basic precautions
• Integrate data protection, including its data security requirements, from the design of the application 
or service. These requirements can result in a variety of architecture choices (decentralised or 
centralised), of functionalities (e.g.: anonymisation done shortly after collection, data minimisation), 
of technologies (e.g.: communication encryption), etc.
• Use community-recognised and secure components (e.g.: libraries) or tools.
• Implement measures against common attacks targeting databases (e.g.: SQL code injections, scripts).
• For any development aimed at the general public, carefully consider the parameters affecting 
privacy and its compliance, in particular the default settings.
• Avoid the use of free text boxes or comments, which are sources of unnecessary or disproportionate 
additional personal data collection.
• Carry out comprehensive tests (e.g.: unit, integration, functional, security testing) before a product is 
made available or updated. During an update, make sure that the tests used are always appropriate.
• Carry out computer development and testing in a distinct computer environment from production 
(e.g. on different computers or virtual machines) and on fictitious or anonymised data.
• Ensure that there are no secrets (authentication or encryption) when submitting code to a version 
management tool (e.g.: Git or svn). Change the secrets when going into production.
• Perform a non-regression test and/or a code review before any update goes to production, in order 
to avoid the emergence of sources of personal data breach.
What should be avoided
• Using real personal data for the development and testing phases. Fictitious datasets should be used 
as much as possible.
• Developing an application and then think about the security or protection measures to be put in 
place regarding personal data.
2956 “Guide RGPD de l'équipe de développement”, lincnil.github.io
57 “Zones bloc note et commentaires : les bons réflexes pour ne pas déraper”, cnil.fr•  The CNIL has published a GDPR guide56  specifically aimed at development teams to help 
them bring their IT developments into line with the regulations regarding the protection of 
personal data.
• Put in place a defence in depth of systems, i.e. a combination of several security measures 
and controls (e.g. control data entered in an online form but also protect database queries). In 
particular, the measures in place on the “frontend” part of an application can be circumvented 
and should be reinforced by measures on the “backend” part.
• Development must impose data entry and recording formats that minimise the data collected.  
For example, if only a person’s year of birth is to be collected, the field of the corresponding 
form should not allow the entry of the month and day of birth. This can mean, in particular, the 
implementation of a drop-down menu limiting the choices for a form field.
• An article dedicated to free text or comment zones is available on the CNIL website .57
• Coding conventions or rules and documentation are essential to maintain the application or 
service over time without introducing new vulnerabilities, and to effectively correct malfunctions.
• Data formats must be compatible with the implementation of the chosen retention period. 
For example, if a digital document is to be kept for 20 years, it may be relevant to favour open 
formats that are more likely to be maintained over the long term.
• The creation and management of user profiles with data access rights varying according to the 
categories of users must be integrated right from the design phase.
• Tests carried out on fictitious or anonymised data are sometimes not sufficient to ensure that a 
new service or feature works properly. It is then possible to test in a pre-production environment 
with real data. The pre-production environment must be configured and secured at the same 
level as the production environment itself and the new service or its update must have already 
undergone all the tests (unit, integration and functional) in the development and testing 
environments.
• Depending on the nature of the application, it may be necessary to ensure its integrity by using 
executable code signatures in order to ensure that it has not undergone any alteration. TO GO FURTHER

58 From their entrance, during their visit and until they leave the premises.FACTSHEET 12 – PROTECTING THE PREMISES
Strengthen the security of premises hosting computer servers and network 
hardware.
Access to premises must be controlled to prevent or slow down unauthorised direct access, whether 
to paper files or computer equipment, including servers. Premises must also be protected against 
other types of threats (e.g. fire, flood).
Basic precautions
• Restrict access to premises by means of locked doors.
• Install intrusion alarms and check their proper operation periodically.
• Set up smoke detectors and firefighting equipment, and inspect them annually.
• Protect keys allowing access to premises as well as alarm codes.
• Distinguish building areas according to risk (e.g.: provide a dedicated access control for the 
computer room).
• Keep an up-to-date list of persons or categories of persons authorised to enter each area and 
periodically review this list.
• Establish rules and means of controlling visitor access, at least by having visitors accompanied58  
outside public reception areas by a person belonging to the organisation.
• Protect network access (e.g.: office sockets, patch bays) and allow only authorised equipment to 
connect to them.
• Physically protect computer equipment with specific measures (e.g.: dedicated firefighting system, 
elevation against possible flooding, power supply redundancy, air conditioning system redundancy).
What should be avoided
• Under designing or neglecting the maintenance of computer room environments (e.g.: air 
conditioning, uninterrupted power supply). A breakdown in these installations often results in the 
shutdown of machines or access to the rooms being opened (to promote air circulation) which 
effectively neutralises the elements contributing to the physical safety of the premises.
• Leaving visible (e.g.: screens of the secretariat easily readable by visitors, meeting rooms with 
screens visible from the outside) or accessible (e.g.: critical printed documents placed in public view 
in reception areas) data that should remain confidential. 
31TO GO FURTHER
• Keep a record of access to rooms or offices likely to contain material processing personal data 
that could have a serious negative impact on data subjects in the event of an incident. Inform 
users of the implementation of such a system, after information and consultation with staff 
representative bodies.
• Ensure that only duly authorised personnel are admitted to restricted access areas. For 
example:
 –inside regulated areas, require all persons to wear a visible means of identification (e.g.: badge);
 –visitors (e.g.: technical support staff) must only have limited access. The date and time of their 
arrival and departure must be recorded;
 –regularly review and update access permissions to secure areas and delete them if necessary. 
32
MY CONTROL OVER 
DATA 
33FACTSHEET 13 – SECURING EXCHANGES WITH THE 
OUTSIDE WORLD
Strengthen the security of any transmission of personal data.
Without additional measures, consumer data transmission channels (e.g. email, instant messaging, 
file storage platforms) are rarely a secure means of communication for transmitting personal data. 
A simple careless mistake can lead unauthorised persons to gain access of personal data, thereby 
infringing the right to privacy of the data subjects. In addition, entities with access to the servers 
through which the information transits may have access to their content or metadata.
Basic precautions
• Encrypt data before it is stored on a physical medium to be transmitted to a third party (e.g. USB 
drive, portable hard drive, optical disk).
• When sending via a network:
 –encrypt the sensitive parts to be transmitted. In this regard, you should refer to the 
recommendations in factsheet 21 – Encryption, hash, signature;
 –use a protocol that ensures confidentiality and authentication of the destination server for file 
transfers (e.g. SFTP or HTTPS), using the most recent versions of the protocols;
 –ensure confidentiality of secrets (e.g.: encryption key, password) by transmitting them via a 
separate channel from protected data (e.g.: sending the encrypted file by e-mail and communicating 
the password by phone or SMS).
• Open a file from outside only if the sender is known and after only after an antivirus scan has been 
carried out.
• When using a fax machine, put in place the following measures:
 –install the fax machine in a physically controlled room and accessible only to authorised staff;
 –display the identity of the fax recipient when sending messages;
 –double the sending by fax with a sending of the original documents to the recipient;
 –pre-register the numbers of potential recipients in the fax address book (if the function exists).
What should be avoided
• Transmitting files containing unencrypted personal data via messaging or other consumer platforms.
• Not planning for the deletion (preferably automatically) of files transmitted using a file transfer 
platform. 
34
TO GO FURTHER
• Use public key algorithms, when different actors have put a public key management 
infrastructure in place to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of communications, as well as 
the authentication of the issuer.
• Have the data electronically signed by the issuer before it is sent in order to ensure that she or 
he is  the originator of the transmission (see factsheet 21 – Encryption, hash, signature).
• Use of a temporary file repository server may also be appropriate. In this case, ensure to:
 –set up a limited time for making files available;
 –restrict access to files to only duly authorised recipients;
 –encrypt files before uploading them to the service if the solution used does not provide for this 
possibility in an integrated way.
• Some communication tools and solutions also protect metadata related to the items being 
exchanged and can be used when these are particularly sensitive.
• For the most sensitive systems, confine files from outside to isolated areas from the rest of the 
system to prevent the spread of malware. 
35FACTSHEET 14 – MANAGING DATA PROCESSORS
Manage data security with processors.
Data processing carried out by a processor on59  behalf of the controller must be subject to 
sufficient safeguards, in particular in terms of security. The data controller must be aware of the 
details of the security measures implemented by its processors in order to be able to demonstrate 
its compliance60 .
Basic precautions
• Use only processors with sufficient guarantees (particularly in terms of specialised knowledge, 
reliability and resources).
• Provide for a contract with the processors61, which defines in particular the subject matter, duration, 
purpose of the processing as well as the obligations of the parties, in particular in terms of security. 
Ensure that it contains, in particular, provisions setting out:
 –the division of responsibilities and obligations relating to the confidentiality of the personal data 
entrusted;
 –minimal user authentication requirements;
 –the conditions for the return and destruction of data at the end of the contract;
 –the rules for managing and notifying incidents. These should include informing the controller in 
the event of a discovery of a security breach or incident, and this should be done as soon as possible 
in the event of a personal data breach62 ;
 –assistance to be provided to the processor to ensure compliance with security obligations63 ;
 –the regular review of security measures and, where appropriate, the conditions for their revision.
• Provide the means to verify the effectiveness of the data protection guarantees offered by the 
processor (e.g.: security audits, site visits). Such guarantees include, but are not limited to:
 –the encryption of data according to their sensitivity or, failing that, the existence of procedures 
ensuring that the service company does not have access to the data entrusted to it if this is not 
necessary for the performance of its contract;
 –encryption of data transmissions (e.g.: HTTPS connection, VPN implementation);
 –guarantees in terms of network protection, traceability, authorisation management, 
authentication, administrator practices, audits, etc.
What should be avoided
• Starting processing data without having signed a contract with the processor that includes the 
requirements laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR.
• Using cloud services without guarantee as to the actual geographical location of the data and 
without ensuring legal conditions and any possible formalities for data transfers outside the European 
Union.
59 Understood within the meaning of the GDPR.
60 Articles 5.2 and 24.1 of the GDPR.
61 The European Commission has published standard contractual clauses on which this contract may be based (see “Clauses 
contractuelles types entre responsable de traitement et sous-traitant”, cnil.fr). 
62 A security incident is characterised as a “personal data breach” when it relates to personal data.
63 Refer to Article 32 of the GDPR and § 41 of Guidelines 07/2020 adopted by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)
36
POUR ALLER PLUS LOIN
• The CNIL has published a guide for processors 64.
• Consult and implement the provisions of Article 28 GDPR.
• Pay particular attention to the choice of a cloud service provider (see factsheet 22 – Cloud 
computing).
• The entire sub processing chain (processors of processors) should be considered and not only direct 
processors.
• When choosing a processor, obtaining a certification is a first index to assess its reliability. For 
example, the international standard ISO/IEC 2700165 requires organisational and technical measures 
for the establishment of an Information Security Management System (ISMS), while ISO/IEC 27701  
covers Privacy Management Systems (PIMS).
• Regarding health data, a hosting provider must have a health data hosting (HDS) certification 66. 
The Digital Health Agency (ANS) publishes a list of certified hosting providers . It is worth noting that a 
certification process has gradually replaced the HDS authorisations since 2018 and that some hosting 
providers67 still have a68  valid authorisation.
• Where appropriate, require the service provider to communicate its certifications and verify their 
scope.

37TO GO FURTHERFACTSHEET 15 – SUPERVISING THE MAINTENANCE AND 
END-OF-LIFE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
Ensure data security at every stage of the hardware and software lifecycle.
Support operations must be supervised to control access to data by service providers. The data must 
first be erased from equipment destined for disposal.
Basic precautions
• Record maintenance interventions in a log book.
• Open the access required for remote maintenance at the service provider’s request, for a pre-
defined period of time appropriate for the intervention. These accesses must be closed again at the 
end of this period.
• Include security clauses in maintenance contracts with service providers to control their access to 
information systems (see sample clause opposite).
• Ensure that third-party interventions are supervised by an organisation manager.
• Do not leave outside contractors alone, especially in sensitive rooms (e.g. server rooms).
• Securely delete the data from equipment before its disposal, its sending for repair to a third party or 
at the end of a rental contract.
What should be avoided
• Installing remote maintenance applications with known vulnerabilities (e.g.: applications that do 
not encrypt communications).
• Reusing, reselling or discarding media that have contain personal data without the data having 
been securely deleted.
• Allowing full or permanent access to systems for remote maintenance.
69 “Certified products”, cyber.gouv.fr
70 Like logging systems, such systems must be set up in accordance with the applicable legal provisions and with information of 
the data subjects.
71 “Recommendations to secure administration of IT systems”, cyber.gouv.fr• Write and implement a secure data deletion procedure.
• Use software dedicated to deleting data without physical destruction that has been qualified 
or certified. ANSSI grants first-level certifications69  to such software.
• Implement real-time or a posteriori (e.g.: recording) monitoring tools (e.g. “4-eye” sessions) for 
remote maintenance interventions by third parties70 .
• ANSSI dedicates a chapter of its guide71  on secure administration to third-party maintenance.
38
Note: such a maintenance clause must necessarily be coupled with a confidentiality clause for 
processors. Example of a clause that can be used in case of maintenance by a third party:
Each maintenance operation must be the subject of a description specifying the dates, the nature of the operations and the 
names of the involved participants, transmitted to X.
In case of remote maintenance allowing remote access to X’s files, Y will only be able to intervene after X has authorised 
access. Access must be closed at the end of each Y intervention.
[Alternative formulation according to the nature of maintenance:
In case of remote maintenance allowing remote access to X’s files, Y will only be able to intervene after X has been infor-
med, allowing X to identify and monitor access to its information system.
]
Records will be established under the respective responsibilities of X and Y, indicating the date and detailed nature of the 
remote maintenance interventions and the names of their authors.

72 Articles 5.2 et 24.1 du RGPD.FACTSHEET 16 – LOGGING OPERATIONS 
Log operations for the detection of anomalies, malfunctions or incidents and 
have the information useful for their treatment or in the event of litigation.
In order to be able to identify fraudulent access or misuse of personal data, or to determine the origin 
of an incident, it is necessary to log certain actions carried out on IT systems. The logs then collected 
are also useful evidence for the demonstration of compliance72 .
Basic precautions
• Provide a logging system (i.e. recording system in log files) of users’ business activities (application 
logs), technical interventions (including by administrators), anomalies and security-related events 
(technical or system logs).
• Keep these logs for a rolling period of between six months and one year (except, for example, in 
the event of a legal obligation relating to this retention period, the need for litigation management, 
internal control or an identified need for post-incident analysis).
• Perform, for application logs, a record of the creation, consultation, sharing, modification and 
deletion of the data by retaining the author’s identifier, the date, time and nature of the operation as 
well as the reference of the data concerned (to avoid duplication).
• Inform users, e.g. when authenticating or accessing the system, of setting up the logging system, 
after informing and consulting the representative bodies of the staff.
• Protect the logging equipment and the logged information against unauthorised operations (e.g. by 
making them inaccessible to the individuals whose activity is logged), misuse by authorised accounts 
(e.g.: by setting up a use charter or specific alerts) and the crushing of logs generated by the concerned 
applications.
• Ensure the proper functioning of the logging system by integrating the equipment into a monitoring 
tool and regularly checking the presence of exploitable logs.
• Ensure that processors are contractually obliged to implement logging in accordance with these 
recommendations and to notify as soon as possible of any anomaly or security incident to the 
controller.
• Actively analyse, in real time or in the short term, the logs collected to be able to detect the 
occurrence of an incident ( see factsheet 9 – Managing incidents and violations).
What should be avoided
• Duplicating and storing excessively the personal data concerned by the processing within the logs 
(e.g.: saving passwords or their hash when authenticating users).
• Using information from logging systems for purposes other than ensuring the proper use of the 
computer system (e.g. using logs to count hours worked is a misuse of purpose, punishable by law).
• Keeping logs without time limit.

coupled with an appropriate configuration of alerts.
• Set up a collection enclave centralising event logs throughout the information system in order 
to prevent any alteration thereof.

FACTSHEET 17 – SAVING
Perform regular backups to limit the impact of an unwanted data loss or 
alteration.
Backup copies must be made and tested regularly to be available when needed.
Basic precautions
• Make frequent data backups, whether in paper or electronic form. It may be appropriate to provide 
incremental daily76  backups and full backups at regular intervals.
• Store at least one backup on a site geographically separate from the operating site.
• Isolate at least one offline backup, disconnected from the company’s network.
• Protect stored data at the same level of security as those stored on operating servers (e.g. by 
encrypting the backups, by providing storage in a secure place, by contractually framing a service of 
externalisation of backups).
• Encrypt the transmission channel, if it is not internal to the organisation, when backups are 
transmitted through the network.
• Regularly test the integrity of backups and the ability to restore them.
What should be avoided
• Ensuring a lower level of security on the backup system (e.g.: do not save the system itself) only on 
other information systems.
• Keeping backups on the same systems as the backed-up data without isolating them. A threat (e.g.: 
ransomware) could then tackle both data and their backups.
• Keeping backups in the same place as the machines hosting the data. A major disaster occurring 
there would result in a definitive loss of data.
• Never checking if backups are available and realising that this is not the case on the day they are 
needed.
76 An incremental backup consists of saving only changes made compared to a previous backup.
77 “Sauvegarde des systèmes d'information”, cyber.gouv.frTO GO FURTHER
• Protect at least one backup (e.g.: the one that is geographically distinct from the operating site) 
in fireproof and waterproof safes.
• If data and system availability requirements are high, it is advisable to implement data 
replication to a secondary site.
• It is advisable to apply the rule called “3 – 2 – 1”, state of the art in terms of backup, which 
consists of having 3 copies of the data, storing on 2 different media, including 1 offline.
• ANSSI has published recommendations77  on the safeguarding of information systems.
43TO GO FURTHERFACTSHEET 18 – PREDICTING CONTINUITY AND RE-
SUMPTION OF ACTIVITY
Predict degraded operation of information systems and be able to restart 
them without impacting data security.
To limit the downtime of the system, it is necessary to anticipate the most common incidents. 
Ensuring business continuity consists of planning ways to continue to operate, in general in a 
degraded manner, despite malfunctions. The resumption of activity, on the other hand, encompasses 
all the actions necessary to relaunch an established system.
Basic precautions
• Write a business continuity plan (BCP) and a disaster recovery plan (DRP), even summary, for IT 
activity, including the list of stakeholders. The level of data protection should not be reduced by the 
intended operating modes.
• Ensure that users, service providers and subcontractors know who to alert in the event of an incident.
• Regularly test the restoration of backups and the application of the business continuity plan or 
disaster recovery plan.
• About materials:
 –use an inverter to protect equipment used for essential treatments;
 –provide for material redundancy of storage equipment (e.g.: using RAID technology 78).
What should be avoided
• Considering yourself safe.
• Reducing the level of data security when implementing a degraded procedure, without taking into 
account the new risks generated to maintain the activity.
• Not anticipating a return to normal.
• Not testing upstream business continuity or recovery measures.
• The General Secretariat for Defence and National Security (SGDSN) has published79 a  guide 
on the establishment of a business continuity or business resumption plan.
• Define a crisis management organisation.
• Carry out exercises with all stakeholders to verify the effectiveness and assimilation of the 
procedures put in place.
• Targeted tests on certain components or parts of the system may be preferred to limit the 
impact on production. However, the continuity and resumption of the most critical elements 
must be tested from time to time. A test of the complete shutdown of the information system 
should also be considered.
78 RAID (redundant array of independent disk) refers to data distribution techniques on multiple storage media (e.g.: hard drives) 
to prevent data loss following the failure of one of the medias.

81 Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR.
82 The obligation to notify personal data breaches does not relieve the person responsible of his/her potential other incident 
reporting obligations (see “Notifications d’incidents de sécurité aux autorités de régulation : comment s’organiser et à qui 
s’adresser ?”, cnil.fr).FACTSHEET 19 – MANAGING INCIDENTS AND VIOLA-
TIONS
Provide procedures for managing incidents and responding to data breaches 
(infringement of confidentiality, integrity or availability).
It is necessary to be prepared for the possibility of an incident to intervene in a timely and 
appropriate manner, incorporating the objective of limiting the effects for the persons whose data 
are concerned. The data controller may be required to notify the CNIL or inform the data subjects 
of the incident depending on the risk to them.
Basic precautions
• Regularly analyse the logs collected (see factsheet 16 – Logging operations).
• Ensure that the managers of the logging management system (whether internal or external) 
notify the controller, as soon as possible, in the event of an anomaly or security incident.
• Disseminate to all users, both internal and external, the conduct to be followed and the list 
of persons to be contacted in the event of a security incident or an unusual event affecting the 
organisation’s information and communication systems. Make users aware of the importance of 
reporting suspicious events.
• Establish procedures detailing the systems for generating and raising alerts from different sources 
(e.g.: automatic, by users) their processing and the actions to be taken in the event of a proven 
incident (e.g.: persons to contact, actions to limit the incident according to its nature). Include data 
breach management in the incident management process. Define criteria for classifying an incident 
as data breaches.
• Assess the risk to individuals caused by the violation, taking into account the seriousness and 
likelihood of the consequences that the violation may have on their rights and freedoms.
• Keep an internal record of all personal data breaches.
• Notify80  the CNIL, within 72 hours (as provided for in the GDPR), of violations posing a risk to the 
rights and freedoms of individuals and, in the event of a high risk and unless otherwise provided by 
the GDPR81,  inform the data subjects so that they can limit the consequences 82.
What should be avoided
• Waiting for data subjects or third parties to detect and report an incident.
• Omitting the analysis of the risks that a personal data breach could have for the rights and freedoms 
of individuals.
• Waiting for accurate information to notify the CNIL when it is clearly established that a breach 
has occurred. Data notifications can be transmitted in two stages: an initial, within 72 hours, then an 
additional if necessary.
45TO GO FURTHER
• Focus on automatic monitoring of logs, coupled with an appropriate configuration of alerts.
• Establish mandatory training for all staff on identifying and reporting violations as well as on 
what to do in this case.
• The EDPS83  published guidelines84  detailing 18 examples of data breaches, based on practical 
cases encountered by European data protection authorities.
• The Working Party (referred to as “Article 29”) which preceded the EDPS on data protection

88 Article 35 of the GDPR.
89 The vocabulary used in the following description is taken from the AIPD guides published by the CNIL (see “Privacy Impact 
Assessment (PIA)”, cnil.fr).FACTSHEET 20 – RISK ANAL YSIS
Identify risks and assess their likelihood and severity in order to implement the 
appropriate security measures.
Besides complying with the basic precautions presented in this guide, it is relevant, if not mandatory 
according to the criticality of the processing, to carry out data protection risk analyses. These analyses 
provide a basis for deciding on additional security measures, adapted to the context, to limit the 
impact on the data subjects involved in the data processing.
Basic precautions
• Identify the processing of personal data for which a data protection impact assessment (DPIA)87  
must be carried out in accordance with the GDPR88 . A PIA includes not only a part dedicated to 
risks analysis, the topic of this factsheet, but also a part dedicated to the legal aspects of the data 
processing.
• Carry out a risk analysis89 , even a minimal one, based on the following three steps:
1. Identify the processing of personal data, whether automated or not, the data processed (e.g.: 
customer files, contracts) and the media on which they rely:
 –the hardware (e.g.: servers, laptops, hard drives);
 –the software (e.g.: operating systems, business software);
 –the cloud computing resources used (e.g.: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS);
 –the logical or physical communication channels (e.g.: wired connections, Wi-Fi, Internet, verbal 
exchanges, couriers);
 –the paper documents (e.g.: printed documents, photocopies);
 –the physical premises and facilities where the above-mentioned elements are located (e.g.: IT 
rooms, offices).
This step deserves to be carried out independently of any risk analysis (see factsheet 1 – Ma-
naging data security).
2. Assess the risks generated by each processing operation:
a. Identify potential effects on the rights and freedoms of data subjects, for the three following 
feared events:
 –illegitimate access to data (e.g.: identity theft following the disclosure of pay slips for all 
employees of a company);
 –unwanted data modification (e.g.: wrongful accusation of a fault or offence following the 
modification of access logs);
 –temporary or permanent loss of data (e.g.: failure to detect a drug interaction due to the 
impossibility of accessing the patient’s electronic record).
48
b. Identify the sources of risk (who or what could be at the origin of each feared event?), 
taking into account internal and external human sources (e.g. it administrator, user, exter-
nal attacker, competitor) as well as internal and external non-human sources (e.g. water, 
epidemic, hazardous materials, non-targeted computer virus).
c. Identify the possible threats (what could allow each feared event to occur?). These threats occur 
on previously identified media (hardware, software, communication channels, paper documents, 
etc.), which may be:
 –used in an inappropriate way (e.g.: rights abuse, handling error);
 –modified (e.g.: trapped software or hardware- keylogger, installing malicious software);
 –lost (e.g.: theft of a laptop, loss of a USB stick);
 –observed (e.g.: observation of a screen on a train, geolocation of equipment);
 –damaged (e.g.: vandalism, degradation due to natural wear);
 –overloaded (e.g.: full storage unit, denial of service attack).
d. Identify existing or planned measures to reduce each risk (e.g.: access control, backups, 
traceability, security of the premises, encryption, anonymisation).
e. Evaluate the severity (impact or potential harm to the data subjects) and the likelihood 
(probability of occurrence) of the risks with regard to the previous elements (an example of scale 
that can be used for the evaluation: negligible, moderate, large, maximum).
The following table can be used to formalise this reflection:
3. Implement and check the planned measures. If the existing and planned measures are considered 
appropriate, it must be ensured that they are implemented and monitored (see factsheet 1 – Managing 
data security). Otherwise, additional measures must be identified and implemented to reduce the 
severity and/or likelihood of the associated risks.

treatment context.Feared event Effects on

49TO GO FURTHERWhat should be avoided
• Forgetting the impact for data subjects and only considering the impact for the organisation.
• Omitting part of the data processing (e.g.: collection, partners, end-of-life data) to conduct the 
analysis.
• Adjust scales of likelihood and severity during the risk analysis, rather than defining them upstream 
based on the overall context of the organisation.

contain at least “a […] description of the […] operations and the purposes of the processing [...], an 
assessment of necessity and proportionality [...], an assessment of the risks [...] and the measures 
envisaged to address the risks [...] and to demonstrate compliance with the Regulation” (Article 
35.7).
• The CNIL has published guides90  to conduct a DPIA. The CNIL has also published software to 
facilitate the conduct and formalisation of DPIA91 .
• The CNIL has also published lists of processing for which a DPIA is required92 or not 93.
• Security audits are an essential means of assessing the level of security of the systems on 
which the processing of personal data is based. Carried out periodically, they allow to take 
changes in processing and threats into account. Each audit must produce an action plan, the 
implementation of which should be monitored at the highest level of the organisation.
• The assessment of information security risk94  may be conducted at the same time as the 
assessment of privacy risk. These approaches are compatible.
• The risk assessment provides a basis for determining the security measures to be put in place. 
Allocate a budget for their implementation is required.

FACTSHEET 21 – ENCRYPTION, HASH, SIGNATURE
Ensure the integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of information.
Hash functions ensure data integrity. Digital signatures, in addition to ensuring integrity, make it 
possible to verify the signatory’s identity authenticity and to ensure the non-repudiation. Finally, 
encryption95  ensures the confidentiality of a message.
Basic precautions
• Use a recognised and safe algorithm, for example, the following algorithms:
 –SHA-296  or SHA-397  as hash function families;
 –bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2 or PBKDF2 to store passwords;
 –AES98 with an appropriate construction mode (CCM, GCM, or EAX) or ChaCha20  99(with Poly1305) 
for symmetric encryption;
 –RSA-OAEP100 , ECIES-KEM101  or DLIES-KEM101101 for asymmetric encryption;
 –RSA-SSA-PSS100100 or ECDSA102  for signatures.
• Use sufficiently long keys:
 –for AES, 128, 192 or 256 bit keys are considered sufficient;
 –for RSA-based algorithms, it is recommended to use secret modulus and exponents of at least 
2048 bits or 3072 bits, with public exponents, for encryption greater than 65536 bits.
• Apply relevant recommendations for use, specific to the chosen algorithm. Implementation errors 
have a significant impact on the security of the cryptographic mechanism.
• Protect private keys, at least through the implementation of limited access rights and a secure 
password.
• Write a procedure indicating how keys and certificates will be managed considering cases of 
forgotten passwords for unlocking them.
What should be avoided
• Using outdated algorithms, such as DES and 3DES encryption or MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions.
• Confusing hash functions with encryption functions and considering that a hash function alone 
is enough to guarantee data confidentiality. Although hash functions are “one-way” functions, i.e. 
functions that are difficult to reverse, data can be retrieved from its fingerprint. Indeed, since these 
functions are fast at execution, it is often possible to automatically test all the possibilities and thus 
recognise the footprint.
• Hashing passwords without using any salt103 .

FACTSHEET 22 – CLOUD COMPUTING
Secure data and processing in a cloud environment.
Cloud computing is perceived as a faster and more flexible way to deploy new services. However, 
implementing data processing shall always factor the specific risks relevant to cloud computing. 
The cloud service provider must provide sufficient guarantees to ensure that security measures 
were correctly implemented. Nonetheless, the client also has to be involved into securing their 
data and data processing in the cloud, not only to protect them from malicious third parties but also 
from the cloud service provider itself.
Basic precautions
• Map data and processing in the cloud and maintain this mapping up-to-date. Also map cloud 
services in use (including SaaS applications). Identify unused or unmonitored cloud resources, and if 
applicable, remove them.
• Assess the security needs for the implemented data processing then choose:
 –the appropriate service deployment method (public, private, hybrid, community, multi-cloud);
 –the cloud service provider after evaluating their guaranteed level of security (in particular for 
backups, redundancy, encryption, physical security, maintenance security) in accordance to 
recognised cloud security specifications.
• Include cloud services into the risk analysis (see factsheet 20 – Risk analysis), but also in the PCA/PRA 
(see factsheet 18 – Predict continuity and resumption of activity), while considering their specificities.
• Make sure security requirements and liability allocation are covered by a contract between the 
supplier and the customer ( see factsheet 14 – Managing data processors).
• Ensure that all parties involved in the cloud service provisioning actually maintain the level of 
security you agreed upon (the provider itself and its potential subcontractors).
• If relevant, configure the security tools provided by the provider (e.g.: encryption, access and identity 
management, firewall, anti-DDoS tool) in accordance with the internal information systems security 
policy.
• Apply the basic precautions from this guide to cloud processing. In particular:
 –encrypt dormant data as well as transit data and use the appropriate cryptographic key 
management (see factsheet 21 – Encryption, hash, signature). Note that using the key management 
services offered by the service provider implies that the service provider also has the ability to 
access the data;
 –make sure only authorized personnel are assigned with the relevant access and permissions 
rights for resources access (data and applications) in the cloud and apply the principle of less 
privilege (see factsheet 5 – Access management);
 –authenticate users for access to cloud services (see factsheet 4 – Authenticating users) and grant 
only the necessary authorisations (see factsheet 5 – Access management);
 –manage and configure cloud resources permissions;
 –perform backups (see factsheet 17 – Saving) and check that your provider actually has several 
backup data centres that are geographically distant form each other.
53What should be avoided
•  Migrating all data and processing to the cloud, without identifying sensitive data that should not be 
processed in the cloud.
• Neglecting security aspects when selecting the cloud service provider.
• Assuming that the cloud security responsibility is solely lying with the provider.
• Having a lower security assurance level than locally performed processes.
• Forgetting to include telemetry data, diagnostic data and processing data collected by the provider 
in the risk analysis.
• Believing that server-side encryption ensures confidentiality with the provider.
• Not configuring or misconfiguring the security tools provided by the supplier110 .
• Sharing authentication means (e.g.: hard-coded unencrypted identifiers or access keys in the source 
code files of applications or scripts executed in the cloud).
• Using cloud services without ensuring you got actual guarantees about the data physical and 
geographical location and without checking legal conditions and possible formalities for data 
transfers outside the European Union.
• Having a backup policy where the data is hosted in the same data centre as the backup.
• Signing a contract stating that the cloud provider can access data and systems for some purposes 
(including security or legal obligation), without the authorisation of the customer.

• Prioritise providers complying to GDPR codes of conduct111  and ensure that these codes of 
conduct contain specific security requirements and clarifications on cloud -specific regulatory 
obligations. See in particular the codes approved by the authorities after the opinion of the 
European Data Protection Board (EDPB): the CISPE code112  or the EU Cloud code113 .
• Consider the use of a supplier qualified under SecNumCloud114 by ANSSI for the processing of 
particularly sensitive data. Rule R9 of the “cloud at the center” doctrine115 requires the use of 
such a provider for some operators.
• Use a certified health data hosting provider116 (HDS) for the processing of health data in 
accordance with Article L1111-8 of the Public Health Code. The Digital Health Agency (ANS) 
publishes the list of certified hosts117 . Note that certification has gradually replaced HDS 
approval since 2018 and that some hosts still have a118 valid approval.

FACTSHEET 23 – MOBILE APPLICATIONS: DESIGN AND 
DEVELOPMENT
Apply basic security principles to mobile application development.
Mobile applications are one of the main means of accessing digital content and services and involve 
most of the time the processing of personal data. It is necessary for publishers to secure these 
processing and offer the best possible transparency to users.
Basic precautions
• Minimise the processing of personal data by ensuring that each type of data collected is indeed 
necessary for the operation of the application.
• Choose, when selecting, the permissions relevant to the operation of the application and involving 
the minimum additional collection, or even propose alternatives to the user not based on permissions 
(e.g.: geolocation can simplify a geographic search, but can be replaced by manual address entry).
• Secure communications, at least with servers, by encapsulating them in a TLS channel, respecting 
the ANSSI TLS guide121 .
• Store cryptographic secrets securely by means of APIs allowing the use of cryptographic suites 
included in the phone, favouring hardware protections such as Android’s Hardware Keystore122  or 
Apple’s Secure Enclave123 .
• Take into account the possibility of the operating system making automatic backups of any personal 
data. Disable unwanted backups or encrypt data without including the encryption key in backups.
• Use a means of authentication corresponding to the level of security sought when authentication is 
required (e.g. if a person is to be authenticated with certainty, do not use biometric authentication if 
the device used allows the recording of biometric templates of several persons).
What should be avoided
• Contracting with a developer for the realisation of an application without properly defining with him 
the objectives and the technical measures expected in terms of data security and without specifying 
that these requirements are applicable to subsequent subcontractors (see factsheet 14 – Managing 
data processors).
• Integrate or allow its subcontractor to integrate in its application external code elements (or SDKs), 
including those proposed by the publishers of mobile operating systems, without ensuring that they 
themselves comply with state-of-the-art security precautions.

• In general, comply with levels L1 and L2 of the recommendations produced by the OWASP124.
• The mobile application security model should not be based on the integrity of the terminal 
(via a attestation made available by the operating system), except in certain justified cases. The 
service should be designed in such a way as to maintain the level of security even with terminals 
considered as corrupted. Best practices in terms of APIs ( see factsheet 25 – API: Application 
programming interfaces) should be applied to secure the servers used by the application and 
protect them against possible abuse attempts.
• Prioritise the processing and storage of the user’s data directly on his terminal.
• It is desirable that the publisher of an application set up a process to validate all changes made 
to the processing implemented, in particular in terms of security, in order to avoid changes (e.g.: 
maintenance operations, modification of external components) that could impact the overall 
security of the processing.
• It is important to implement processes that ensure the maintenance of the security of the 
application over time, including:
 –adopting a Continuous Integration and Deployment Methodology (CI/CD) to enable frequent 
application updates, especially in the case of security updates;
 –informing users of the availability of critical updates (e.g.: an information banner), or even by 
blocking certain server-level functionalities for insecure versions of the application;
 –maintaining vigilance regarding external elements embedded in applications, in particular in 
the face of the risk of malicious evolution in SDKs or libraries used, via supply chain security 
practices as described in ANSSI’s analyses125 ;
 –ensuring that the expected level of security can remain the same, for as long as possible, 
regardless of the version of the OS used. So that a user who would not want or could not access 
a recent device can benefit from a sufficient level of security.

126 Les attaques par inversion de modèle visent à reconstituer les données ayant servi pour l’apprentissage du système.FACTSHEET 24 – ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: DESIGN 
AND LEARNING
Equip yourself with the necessary resources and tools to develop a robust, 
reliable and efficient AI system.
Whether training a new model or integrating an existing model into a software or an application 
ecosystem, the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system requires the implementation of 
certain specific security measures. The large volume of training data, as well as the complexity of these 
systems, increases the attack surface and the risk of failure that can have serious consequences for the 
reliability of the system. This factsheet lists several technical and organisational recommendations to 
achieve a first level of safety.
Basic precautions
• Set up a development team with multidisciplinary skills (data analysis and engineering, user 
interface and user experience, quality control, IT infrastructure administration, business teams), 
ensure its training on good security practices and raise awareness of AI vulnerabilities.
• Implement a mandatory procedure for the continuous development and integration, based on 
comprehensive and robust tests, access subject to authorisation and authentication adapted to the 
profiles (see factsheet 4 – Authenticating users), in particular for changes to the production code (see 
factsheet 11 – Managing IT developments).
• Check the quality of data and annotations, the possible presence of bias, the reliability of data 
sources, in particular in order to prevent the data from being manipulated by a third party (e.g. 
poisoning).
• Avoid partial or total copies of databases and restrict access and use of databases only to authorised 
persons in cases requiring it. Use fictitious or synthetic data in other cases, such as security testing, 
integration, or some audits.
• Build a documentary collection for developers and users of the system, including:
 –the design of the system, including the data and models used and the analyses which led to their 
selection and validation, and the results of those analyses;
 –the operation of the system throughout its life cycle, its performances, the analysis of its biases 
and the results obtained, its conditions and limitations of use, such as cases where performance 
may be insufficient;
 –the material equipment necessary for the use of the system, the expected latency or the maximum 
capacity for systems accessible in SaaS.
• Verify the legitimacy of users of the system when it is made available as a service, in order to avoid 
an attack attempt such as an attack by model inversion126 or denial of service.
• Provide for an audit plan of the system, covering software, hardware, and organisational measures 
such as procedures for human oversight of the AI system.
57TO GO FURTHERWhat should be avoided
• Training a model on data whose source is unknown or unreliable, or whose quality, and in particular 
the quality of the annotation, has not been verified.
• Deploying, sharing, disseminating or making accessible a model without checking the quality of 
outputs, and in particular the absence of problematic outputs (e.g. hate content) and personal data,  
except for testing and audit purposes.
• Using a system without knowing its limitations, or without assessing the consequences of an error 
or bias.
127 “AI how-to sheets”, cnil.fr
128 “Petite taxonomie des attaques des systèmes d’IA” , linc.cnil.fr
129 “Sécurité des systèmes d’IA, les gestes qui sauvent”, linc.cnil.fr   • The CNIL has published a set of factsheets127 on the development phase of AI systems involving 
personal data.
• The models of attacks on AI systems are diverse and still little known. The CNIL Digital 
Innovation Laboratory (LINC) has published a first article listing these attacks128 as well as a 
second identifying good security practices to protect themselves129 (such as federated learning, 
or differential privacy).
• The collection of personal data can be minimised by data augmentation or data synthesis 
techniques, or by focusing the collection on quality data.
• The data used during the deployment phase can change over time, and lose quality for several 
reasons (e.g.: deterioration of a sensor, drifting or poisoning data). These changes need to be 
monitored.
• The result provided by the system can be accompanied by information allowing the user to 
interpret it and identify a possible error (e.g.: confidence score, salience map).
• Measures, such as output filters, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or 
watermarking of generated content, make it possible to secure the content produced by the 
system.

130 The data re-user is any organization considering accessing or receiving data through an API for use on its own account.FACTSHEET 25 – API: APPLICATION PROGRAMMING 
INTERFACES
Ensure that shared data is secured through the implementation of an API.
The use of application programming interfaces (APIs) is a good practice for many cases of personal 
data exchange, as APIs can help to make these exchanges more reliable, minimal and secure. To do 
this, API management must be part of the information systems security policy and be coordinated 
between API providers and consumers.
Basic precautions
• Identify the actors and their functional role (data holder, API manager, re-user130 ) in order to 
organise the allocation perimeter of each in terms of access to APIs and data.
• Limit the sharing to strictly necessary data, only to individuals and for the intended purposes, in 
accordance with the principle of minimisation.
• Create a separation between calls to the common functions of the API and those dedicated to its 
administration, for which robust authentication appears necessary.
• Have relevant logs to track exchanges (see factsheet 16 – Logging operations) and to detect and 
react in the event of misuse of the API, illegitimate access to data, exceeding access capacity or any 
other unusual behaviour (see factsheet 19 – Managing incidents and violations).
• Keep the documentation up-to-date. This must include the format of the queries and data involved 
in the sharing in order to limit the risk of a misinterpretation.
What should be avoided
• Keep old versions of an API active that do not allow the expected level of security to be maintained.
• Neglect the security of API access keys, while secret security solutions, such as a digital safe, exist.

131 “OWASP API Security Top 10”, owasp.org
132 “API : les recommandations de la CNIL sur le partage de données”, cnil.fr• Before the launch of an API, check its resistance to the risks published by the OWASP in its 
Top 10 API 131.
• See the CNIL132  recommendation on Secure Data Sharing by API.
• The implementation of the API must be in accordance with standard security measures 
such as the implementation of an appropriate authentication mechanism (see factsheet 4 – 
Authenticating users), the periodic management of authorisations (see factsheet 5 – Access 
management) or the encryption of communications at the state of the art.
• A sandbox version of the API should be made available to allow experiments and test the 
expected results from fictitious data.
