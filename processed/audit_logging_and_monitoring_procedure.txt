Audit	Logging	and	Monitoring	Procedure	(V1.1)	Procedure	HSX	will	perform	the	following	activities	each	month	looking	for	suspected	misuse	of	protected	health	information.	This	procedure	applies	to	all	employees,	interns,	contractors,	and	users	accessing	HSX’s	data	and	systems.	All	users	are	noti?ied	of	monitoring	and	consent	to	having	their	activity	monitored.	Monitoring	includes	privileged	operations,	authorized	access,	unauthorized	access	attempts,	and	system	alerts	or	failures.	Separation	of	duties	is	used	to	limit	the	risk	of	unauthorized	or	unintentional	modi?ication	of	information	and	systems.		Separation	of	duties	is	maintained	and	accomplished	in	HSX	by	segregating	the	duties	of	individual.	User	who	request	access	is	never	the	user	who	authorize/provide	access.	Access	to	system	audit	tools	and	audit	trails	is	protected	and	controlled	to	prevent	unauthorized	access	and	use.	Administrators	are	the	only	users	allowed	to	access	system	audit	tools	and	audit	trails.		90	Day	Inac0vity	HSX	will	lock	accounts	that	have	been	inactive	for	more	than	90	Days.		Except	for	speci?ic	accounts	that	are	used	for	speci?ic	Use	Cases	that	require	them	to	be	activated	upon	and	are	already	locked	until	needed.	Audit	Records	A	secure	audit	log	record	is	created	for	all	activities	on	the	system	(create,	read,	update,	delete)	involving	covered	information.	Authorized	access	and	unauthorized	access	attempts	to	the	audit	systems	and	audit	trails	is	logged	and	protected	from	modi?ication	in	line	with	HSX’s	Audit	Logging	and	Monitoring	Policy.	Event	logs	are	not	to	be	kept	on	the	same	server	as	the	application.		Auditing	is	always	available	while	the	system	is	active	and	tracks	key	events,	success/failed	data	access,	system	security	con?iguration	changes,	privileged	or	utility	use,	any	alarms	raised,	activation	and	de-activation	of	protection	systems	(e.g.,	A/V	and	IDS),	and	identi?ication	and	authentication	mechanisms,	and	creation	and	deletion	of	system-level	objects.	Audit	logs	are	maintained	for	management	activities,	system	and	application	startup/shutdown/errors,	?ile	changes,	and	security	policy	changes.	 1Audit Logging and Monitoring Procedure

Auditing	and	monitoring	systems	employed	by	HSX	support	audit	reduction	and	report	generation.	The	organization’s	system	clocks	are	synchronized	to	an	agreed,	authoritative	real-time	standard	(e.g.,	daylight	savings	time)	and	synchronize	daily	and	at	system	boot.	The	agreed,	authoritative	real-time	standard	is	in	compliance	with	The	Of?icial	NIST	US	time.	Time	data	is	protected	and	controlled	from	unauthorized	access.	No	single	person	is	able	to	access,	modify,	or	use	information	systems	without	authorization	or	detection.	No	single	person	is	able	to	access	or	modify	the	time	zone	settings.	Any	changes,	including	deletions	from	the	event	log	are	tracked	in	the	event	log.		Laptops	are	synchronized	from	time	zones	automatically	based	on	current	location	(eastern	daylight,	closest	city	being	Philadelphia),	date	and	tie	set	automatically	time.apple.com	(every	hour).		Mirth	applications	are	synchronized	from	the	west	coast	but	they	are	translated	to	the	east	coast.	Translated	to	the	current	time	zone	of	your	location.		[REDACTED]	instances	are	synchronized	from	UTC/GMT	time,	everything	is	programmed	in	UTC	time.			•All	audit	information	is	stored	and	archived	in	the	Mirth	application	forever.	Access	to	the	audit	logs	are	restricted	to	administrators	only.		Individuals	responsible	for	administering	access	is	limited	to	the	minimum	necessary	based	upon	each	users'	role	and	responsibilities	and	these	individuals	cannot	access	audit	functions	related	to	these	controls.	•The	information	system	is	able	to	automatically	process	audit	records	for	events	of	interest	based	on	selectable	criteria.	1.Log	into	the	speci?ic	Mirth	application	that	is	being	monitored	(e.g.	Mirth	Results,	Mirth	Match,	Mirth	Mail,	Mirth	SSO)	2.Click	on	the	“Administration”	tab	3.Under	the	“Auditing”	section,	click	on	“Event	log”.

If	use	of	covered	information	is	still	required,	then access	will	be	granted	for	another	ninety	(90)	days.	Any	extract	of	covered	information shall	require	the	CISO’s	permission.	Upon	permission	being	granted,	the	CISO	shall	maintain	a	record	and update	as	needed. Automated	Systems	Automated systems deployed throughout HSX are used to monitor key events and analyze system logs, the results of which are reviewed at least annually by the CISO. Automated systems support near real-time analysis and alerting of events (e.g., malicious code, potential intrusions) and integrate intrusion detection into access and flow control mechanisms. HSX uses [Redacted] to monitor for privacy and security breaches surrounding covered information. •All event logs are sent daily to [Redacted] for monitoring purposes.	•[Redacted] runs algorithms and metrics against HSX’s event logs daily and monitors users in search for suspicious activity	•Any and all suspicious activity to reported to HSX as potential privacy and security breaches each day as such suspicious activity may be found.	•HSX’s Technical Operations team and CISO review alerts whenever received and decide whether or not to proceed with investigations as may be required	•Once an investigation is launched, all information on the user in question is reviewed. If needed, the CISO will conduct an interview with the user in question 	•HSX’s Technical Operations team and CISO will decide if the reported suspicious activity is indeed a breach or not. 	HSX also uses [Redacted] to analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories and correlates this information with input from non-technical sources. HSX copies all events and sends them to [Redacted] for analysis.  3Audit Logging and Monitoring Procedure
