INTRODUCTION 
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is committed to leading the response to 
cybersecurity incidents and vulnerabilities to safeguard the nation's critical assets. Section 6 of 
Executive Order 14028 directed DHS, via CISA, to “develop a standard set of operational procedures (playbook) to be used in planning and conducting cybersecurity vulnerability and incident response 
activity respecting Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Information Systems.” 
1 
Overview 
This document presents two playbooks: one for incident response and one for vulnerability response. 
These playbooks provide FCEB agencies with a standard set of procedures to identify, coordinate, 
remediate, recover, and track successful mitigations from incidents and vulnerabilities affecting FCEB 
systems, data, and networks. In addition, future iterations of these playbooks may be useful for organizations outside of the FCEB to standardize incident response practices. Working together across all federal government organizations has proven to be an effective model for addressing vulnerabilities and incidents. Building on lessons learned from previous incidents and incorporating industry best 
practices, CISA intends for these playbooks to evolve the federal government’s practices for 
cybersecurity response through standardizing shared practices that bring together the best people and 
processes to drive coordinated actions . 
The standardized processes and procedures described in these playbooks: 
•
 Facilitate better coordination and effective response among affected 
organizations, 
• Enable tracking of cross -organizational successful ac tions, 
• Allow for cataloging of incidents to better manage future events, and 
• Guide analysis and discovery. 
A
gencies should use these playbooks to help shape overall defensive cyber operations to ensure 
consistent and effective response and coordinated communication of response activities 
Scope 
These playbooks are for FCEB entities to focus on criteria for response and thresholds for coordination 
and reporting. They include communications between FCEB entities and CISA; the connective 
coordination between incident and vulnerability response activities; and common definitions for key 
cybersecurity terms and aspects of the response process. Response activities in scope of this playbook include those: 
•
 Initiated by an FCEB agency (e.g., a local detection of malicious activity or 
discovery of a vulnerability) 
• Initiated by CISA (e.g., a CISA alert or directive) or other third parties, including law enforcement, intelligence agencies, or commercial organizations, 
contractors, and service provider s 
The I
ncident Res ponse Playbook applies to incidents that involve confirmed malicious cyber activity 
and for which a major incident (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] in

Memorandum M-20-042 or successor memorandum) has been declared or not yet been r easonably 
ruled out. The Vulnerability Response Playbook applies to vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the 
wild. As required by EO 14028, the Director of OMB will issue guidance on FCEB agency use of these 
playbooks . 
Note: these playbooks do not cover response activities that involve threats to classified information or 
National Security Systems (NSS) as defined by 44 U.S.C.3552(b)(6). See CNSSI10103 for 
coordination/reporting guidance for incidents specific to NSS or systems that process classified 
information. 
Audience 
These playbooks apply to all FCEB agencies, information systems used or operated by an agency, a 
contractor of an agency, or another organization on behalf of an agency. It is the policy of the federal 
government that information and communications technology (ICT) service providers who have 
contracted with FCEB agencies must promptly report incidents to such agencies and to CISA .4

INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAYBOOK 
This playbook provides a s tandardized response 
process for cybersecurity incidents and describes 
the process and completion through the incident response phases as defined in National Institute of 
Standards and Technology ( NIST ) Special 
Publication (SP) 800-61 Rev. 2,
5 including 
preparation, detection and analysis, containment, 
eradication and recovery, and post -incident 
activities. This playbook describes the process 
FCEB agencies should follow for confirmed 
malicious cyber activity for which a major incident 
has been declared or not yet been reasonably ruled out. 
•
 Incident response can be initiated by several 
types of events , including but not limited to: 
• Automated detection systems or sensor alerts 
• Agency user report 
• Contractor or third -party ICT service provider 
report 
• Internal or external organizational component incident report or situational 
awareness update 
• Third- party reporting of network activity to 
known compromised infrastructure, detection 
of malicious code, loss of services, etc. 
• Analytics or hunt teams that identify potentially malicious or otherwise unauthorized activity 
Incident Response Process 
The incident response process starts with the declaration of the incident , as shown in Figure 1. In this 
context, “declaration” refers to the identification of an incident and communication to CISA and agency 
network defenders rather than formal declaration of a major incident as defined in applicable law and 
policy. Succeeding sections, which are organized by phases of the IR lifecycle, describe each step in 
more detail. Many activities are iterative and may continuously occur and evolve until the incident is closed out. Figure 1 illustrates incident response activities in terms of these phases, and Appendix B 
provides a companion checklist to track activities to completion. When to use this playbook  
Use this playbook for incidents that involve confirmed 
malicious cyber activity for which a major incident has been declared or not yet been reasonably ruled out. 
For example: 
• Incidents involving lateral movement, credential 
access, exfiltration of data 
• Network intrusions involving more than one user or 
system 
• Compromised administrator accounts 
This playbook does not apply to activity that does not appear to have such major incident potential, such as: 
• “Spills” of classified information or other incidents that are believed to result from unintentional 
behavior only 
• Users clicking on phishing emails when no 
compromise results 
• Commodity malware on a single machine or lost hardware that, in either case, is not likely to result 
in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.

Figure 1: Incident Response Process 
Preparation Phase 
Prepare for major incidents before they occur to mitigate any impact on the 
organization. Preparation activities include: 
•
 Documenting and understanding policies and procedures for incident response 
• Instrumenting the environment to detect suspicious and malicious activity 
• Establishing staffing plans 
• Educating users on cyber threats and notification procedures 
• Leveraging cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to proactively identify potential 
malicious activity 
D
efine baseline systems and networks before an incident occurs to understand the basics of “normal” 
activity. Establishing baselines enables defenders to identify deviations. Preparation also includes 
•
 Having infrastructure in place to handle complex incidents, including classified and out -of-band communications 
• Developing and testing courses of action (COAs) for containment and eradication 
• Establishing means for collecting digital forensics and other data or evidence 
The goal
 of these items is to ensure resilient architectures and systems to maintain critical operations in 
a compromised state. Active defense measures that employ methods such as redirection and 
monitoring of adversary activities may also play a role in developing a robust incident response.

Preparation Activities 
Policies and Procedures 
Document incident response plans, including 
processes and procedures for designating a coordination lead (incident manager). Put policies and procedures in place to escalate and report 
major incidents and those with impact on the 
agency’s mission. Document contingency plans for additional resourcing and “surge support” with assigned roles and responsibilities. Policies and 
plans should address notification, interaction, and evidence sharing with law enforcement. 
Instrumentation 
Develop and maintain an accurate picture of 
infrastructure (systems, networks, cloud platforms, and contractor -hosted networks) by 
widely implementing telemetry to support system and sensor -based detection and monitoring 
capabilities such as antivirus (AV) software; endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
solutions;
6 data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities; 
intrusion detection and prevention systems 
(IDPS); authorization, host, application and cloud 
logs;7 network flows, packet capture (PCAP); and 
security information and event management 
(SIEM) systems. Monitor for alerts generated by 
CISA's EINSTEIN intrusion detection system and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program to detect changes in cyber posture. 
Implement additional requirements for logging, log 
retention, and log management based on 
Executive Order 14028, Sec. 8. Improving the Federal Government's Investigative and Remediation Capabilities
8 and ensure those logs 
are collected centrally.

Vulnerabilities and Incidents on Federal Government 
Networks 
7 NIST SP 800 -92: Guide to Computer Security Log 
Management Trained Response Personnel 
Ensure personnel are trained, exercised, and 
ready to respond to cybersecurity incidents. Train all staffing resources that may draw from in- house 
capabilities, available capabilities at a parent 
agency/department, third -party organization, or a 
combination thereof. Conduct regular recovery 
exercises to test full organizational continuity of operations plan (COOP) and 
failover/back up/recovery systems to be sure these 
work as planned. 
COOP Planning Procedures 
The construction of an agency’s COOP planning 
process should closely adhere to Presidential Policy Directive (PPD- 40), National Continuity 
Policy, July 2016, and Federal Continuity Directive (FCD) 1
9, January 2017, as well as other 
applicable directives and guidance. Designate 
and provide CISA with both a primary and a 
secondary POC to coordinate COOP activities; 
POC information shall include names, phone 
numbers, and email addresses. 
COOP Testing Procedures 
In line with the requirements of FCD -1, and in 
addition to conducting any mandatory Continuity 
Test, Training, Exercise (TT&E), agencies should conduct organization- specific Continuity TT&E 
annually, with Alert/Notification/Employee Accountability and Communications testing on a 
quarterly basis. 
As a best -practice, agencies should ensure the 
development and maintenance of CIO -approved 
informational technology and/or operational 
technology recovery plans.

Cyber Threat Intelligence 
Actively monitor intelligence feeds for threat or 
vulnerability advisories from government, trusted partners, open sources, and commercial entities. 
Cyber threat intelligence can include threat 
landscape reporting, threat actor profiles and intents, organizational targets and campaigns, as well as more specific threat indicators and courses of action. Ingest cyber threat indicators 
and integrated threat feeds into a SIEM , and use 
other defensive capabilities to identify and block known malicious behavior. Threat indicators can 
include: 
• Atomic indicators, such as domains and 
IP addresses, that can detect adversary infrastructure and tools 
• Computed indicators, such as Yara rules and regular expressions, that detect 
known malicious artifacts or signs of 
activity 
• Patterns and behaviors, such as analytics that detect adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) 
Atomic indicators can initially be valuable to 
detect signs of a known campaign. However, because adversaries often change their infrastructure (e.g., watering holes, botnets, C2 
servers) between campaigns, the “shelf -life” of 
atomic indicators to detect new adversary activity 
is limited. In addition, advanced threat actors might leverage different infrastructure against 
different targets or switch to new infrastructure 
during a campaign when their activities are 
detected. Finally, adversaries often hide in their targeted environments, using native operating system utilities and other resources to achieve 
their goals. For these reasons, agencies should 
use patterns and behaviors, or adversary TTPs, to identify malicious activity when possible. Although more difficult to apply detection methods and 
verify application, TTPs provide more useful and

Framework for guidance on using ATT&CK to analyze and 
report on cybersecurity threats.

intentions, and their methods than atomic indicators alone. The MITRE ATT&CK
® 
Framework documents and explains adversary 
TTPs in detail making it a valuable resource for 
network defenders.10 
Sharing cyber threat intelligence is a critical 
element of preparation. FCEB agencies are 
strongly encouraged to continuously share cyber 
threat intelligence—including adversary indicators, TTPs, and associated defensive 
measures (also known as “countermeasures”) — 
with CISA and other partners. The primary 
method for sharing cyber threat information, 
indicators, and associated defensive measures with CISA is via the Automated Indicator Sharing 
(AIS) program .
11 FCEB agencies should be 
enrolled in AIS . If the agency is not enrolled in 
AIS, contact CISA for more information.12 
Agencies should use the CISA Cyber Threat 
Indicator and Defensive Measures Submission System —a secure, web- enabled method —to 
share with CISA cyber threat indicators and 
defensive measures that are not applicable or 
appropriate to share via AIS .
13 
Active Defense 
FCEB agencies with advanced defensiv e 
capabilities and staff might establish active defense capabilities —such as the ability to 
redirect an adversary to a sandbox or honeynet 
system for additional study, or “dark nets” —to 
delay the ability of an adversary to discover the 
agency’s legitimate infrastructure. Network defenders can implement honeytokens (fictitious data objects) and fake accounts to act as canaries 
for malicious activity. These capabilities enable 
defenders to study the adversary’s behavior and TTPs and thereby build a full pictu re of adversary 
capabilities.

procedures and mechanisms for coordinating 
major incidents with CISA and other sharing

protocols to use (i.e., agreed- upon standards). 
Define methods for handling classified information and data, if required. Establish communication channels (chat rooms, phone bridges) and 
method for out -of-band coordination.
14 
Operational Security (OPSEC) 
Take steps to ens ure that IR and defensive 
systems and processes will be operational during 
an attack, particularly in the event of pervasive 
compromises —such as a ransomware attack or 
one involving an aggressive attacker that may 
attempt to undermine defensive measures and distract or mislead defenders. These measures 
include: 
•
 Segmenting and managing SOC systems 
separately from the broader enterprise IT systems, 
• Managing sensors and security devices via out -of-band means, 
• Notifying users of compromised systems via phone rather than email, 
• Using hardened workstations to conduct monitoring and response activities, and 
• Ensuring that defensive systems have robust backup and recovery processes. 
A
void “tipping off” an attacker by having 
processes and systems to reduce the likelihood of 
detection of IR activities (e.g., do not submit malware samples to a public analysis service or 
notify users of potentially comprised machines via email). Technical Infrastructure 
Implement capabilities to contain, replicate, 
analyze, reconstitute, and document compromised hosts; implement the capability to 
collect digital forensics and other data. Establish 
secure storage (i.e., only accessible by incident responders) for incident data and reporting. Provide means for collecting forensic evidence, such as disk and active memory imaging, and 
means for safely handling malware. Obtain 
analysis tools and sandbox software for analyzing malware. Implement a ticketing or c ase 
management system that captures pertinent 
details of: 
•
 Anomalous or suspicious activity, such as 
affected systems, applications, and users; 
• Activity type; 
• Specific threat group(s); 
• Adversary tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) employed; and 
• Impact. 
Detect Activity 
Leverage threat intelligence to create rules and signatures to identify the activity associated with the incident and to scope its reach. Configure 
tools and analyze logs and alerts. Look for signs 
of incident activity and potentially related information to determine the type of incident, e.g., malware attack, system compromise, session 
hijack, data corruption, data exfiltration, etc. 
See Appendix C for a checklist for preparation 
activities.

  Detection & Analysis TLP:CLEAR 
The most challenging aspect of the incident response process is often accurately 
detecting and assessing cybersecurity incidents: determining whether an incident 
has occurred and, if so, the type, extent, and magnitude of the compromise within cloud,  operational technology (OT), hybrid, host, and network systems. To detect 
and analyze events, implement defined processes, appropriate technology, and 
sufficient baseline information to monitor, detect, and alert on anomalous and suspicious activity. Ensure there are procedures to deconflict potential incidents with authorized activity (e.g., confirm that 
a suspected incident is not simply a network administrator using remote admin tools to perform 
software updates). As the U.S. government’s lead for asset response, CISA will partner with affected agencies in all aspects of the detection and analysis process. 
Detection& Analysis Activities 
Declare Incident 
Declare an incident by reporting it to CISA at 
https://www.cisa.gov/report and alerting agency IT 
leadership to the need for investigation and 
response. Report major incidents to CISA and to 
OMB at CyberIncidentReport@omb.eop.gov . 
CISA can assist in determining the severity of the 
incident and whether it should be declared a major incident. Note: FCEB agencies must 
promptly report all cybersecurity incidents, 
regardless of severity, to CISA 
Determine Investigation Scope 
Use available data to identify the type of access, 
the extent to which assets have been affected, the 
level of privilege attained by the adversary, and 
the operational or informational impact. Discover associated malicious activity by following the trail of network data; discover associated host -based 
artifacts by examining host, firewall, and proxy 
logs along with other network data, such as router 
traffic. Initial scoping of an incident to determine adversarial activity may include analyzing results from: 
•
 An automated detection system or sensor; 
• A report from a user, contractor, or third-
party information and communication technologies (ICT) service provider; or 
• An incident report or situational

Handling Guide awareness update from other internal or external organizational components. 
Collect and Preserve Data 
Collect and preserve data for incident verification, 
categorization, prioritization, mitigation, reporting, and attribution. When necessary and possible, such information should be preserved and 
safeguarded as best evidence for use in any 
potential law enforcement investigation. Collect data from the perimeter, the internal network, and the endpoint (server and host). Collect audit, transaction, intrusion, connection, system 
performance, and user activity logs. When an 
endpoint requires forensic analysis, capture a memory and disk image for evidence preservation. Collect evidence, including forensic 
data, according to procedures that meet all 
applicable policies and standards and account for it in a detailed log that is kept for all evidence. For more information, see NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, SP 800 -61 r2.

all relevant threat information (atomic, computed, and behavioral indicators and countermeasures) 
to share with IR teams and with CISA.

determine root cause, and document adversary 
TTPs to enable prioritization of the subsequent response activities. The goal this analysis is to 
examine the breadth of data sources throughout the environment to discover at least some part of 
an attack chain, if not all of it. As information 
evolves and the investigation progresses, update 
the scope to incorporate new information. 
Correlate Events and Document Timeline 
Acquire, store, and analyze logs to correlate 
adversarial activity. Table 1 below presents an 
example of logs and event data that are commonly employed to detect and analyze attacker activities.
16,17 A simple knowle dge base 
should be established for reference during response to the incident. Thoroughly document every step taken during this and subsequent phases. Create a timeline of all relevant findings. The timeline will allow the team to account for all 
adversary activity on the network and will assist in 
creating the findings report at the conclusion of the response. 
Identify Anomalous Activity 
Assess and profile affected systems and networks 
for subtle activity that might be adversary 
behavior. Adversaries will often use legitimate, native operating system utilities and scripting languages once they gain a foothold in an 
environment to avoid detection. This process will 
enable the team to identify deviations from the established baseline activity and can be partic ularly important in identifying activities such 
as attempts to leverage legitimate credentials and 
native capabilities in the environment. 
Identify Root Cause and Enabling Conditions

response efforts. Identify the conditions that enabled the adversary to access and operate within the environment. These conditions will inform triage and post -incident activity. Asses s 
networks and systems for changes that may have been made to either evade defenses or facilitate 
persistent access. 
Gather Incident Indicators 
Identify and document indicators that can be used 
for correlative analysis on the network. Indicators 
can provide insight into the adversary’s capabilities and infrastructure. Indicators as standalone artifacts are valuable in the early 
stages of incident response. 
Analyze for Common Adversary TTPs 
Compare TTPs to adversary TTPs documented in 
ATT&CK and analyze how the TTPs fit into the attack lifecycle. TTPs describe “why,” “what,” and 
“how.” Tactics describe the technical objective an 
adversary is trying to achieve (“why”), techniques are different mechanisms they use to achieve it (“what”), and procedures are ex actly how the 
adversary achieves a specific result (“how”). 
Responding to TTPs enables defenders to 
hypothesize the adversary’s most likely course of action. Table 1 provides some common adversary 
techniques that should be investigated.

Validate and Refi ne Investigation Scope 
Using available data and results of ongoing 
response activities, identify any additional potentially impacted systems, devices, and associated accounts. From this information, new 
indicator of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs might 
be identified that can provide further feedback into detection tools. In this way, an incident is scoped over time. As information evolves, update and

Key Questions to Answer 
• What was the initial attack vector? (i.e., How did the adversary gain initial access  to the network?) 
• How is the adversary accessing the environment? 
• Is the adversary exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve access or privilege? 
• How is the  adversary maintaining command and control? 
• Does the actor have persistence on the network or device? 
• What is the method of persistence (e.g., malware backdoor, webshell, legitimate credentials, remote tools, etc.)? 
• What accounts have been compromised and  what privilege level (e.g., domain admin, local admin,  user account, etc.)? 
• What method is being used for reconnaissance? (Discovering the reconnaissance method may provide an opportunity for 
detection and to determine possible intent.) 
• Is lateral movement suspected or known? How is lateral movement conducted (e.g., RDP, network shares, malware, etc.)? 
• Has data been exfiltrated and, if so, what kind and via what mechanism?

Third -Party Analysis Support (if needed): 
For potentially major incidents, agencies needing 
assistance can reach out to CISA. Each FCEB 
agency has a Federal Network Authorization (FNA) on file with CISA to enable incident response and hunt assistance. When seeking 
outside assistance, the default first action by the 
impacted agency should be to activate their standing FNA and request CISA assistance. Based on availability, CISA may provide a threat 
hunting team to assist.
19CISA may collaborate 
with other agencies —such as the National 
Security Agency (NSA) or U.S. Cyber Command— to provide expertise or supplement 
CISA’s capabilities. 
Agencies may also bring on a third -party IR 
service provider to assist. Such providers 
supplement rather than replace the assistance 
provided by CISA. An FCE B agency using third-
party assistance is responsible for coordinating with CISA and facilitating access during the incident response, including access to externally 
hosted systems. 
Adjust Tools: 
The IR team should use its developing 
understanding of the adversary’s TTPs to modify tools to slow the pace of the adversarial advance and increase the likelihood of detection. The focus 
should be on preventing and detecting tactics — 
such as execution, persistence, credential access, 
lateral movement, and command and control —to 
minimize the likelihood of exfiltration and/or 
operational or informational impact. IOC 
signatures can be incorporated into prevention and detection tools to impose temporary operational cost upon the adversary and assist with scoping the incident. However, the adversary 
can introduce new tools to the network and/or 
modify existing tools to subvert IOC- centric 
response mechanisms. 
19 Level of CISA analysis support will be determined by 
resources available and priority of incident.

  Containment TLP:CLEAR 
Containment is a high priority for incident response, especially for major in cidents . 
The objective is to prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of the 
incident by removing the adversary’s access. The particular scenario will drive they 
type of containment strategy used. For example, the containment approach to an 
active sophisticated adversary using fileless malware will be different than the 
containment approach for ransomware. 
Considerations 
When evaluating containment courses of action, 
consider : 
•
 Any additional adverse impacts to mission 
operations, availability of services (e.g., 
network connectivity, services provided to 
external parties), 
• Duration of the containment process, resources needed, and effectiveness 
(e.g., full vs. partial containment; full vs. 
unknown level of containment), and 
• Any impact on the collection, preservation, securing, and documentation of evidence. 
S
ome adversaries may actively monitor defensive 
response measures, and shift their methods to 
evade detection and contai nment . Defenders 
should therefore develop as complete a picture as 
possible of the attacker’s capabilities and potential reactions to avoid “tipping off” the adversary. 
Containment is challenging because defenders 
must be as complete as possible in identif ying 
adversary activity, while considering the risk of allowing the adversary to persist until the full 
scope of the compromise can be determined. 
Containment activities for major incidents should 
be closely coordinated with CISA. 
Containment Activities 
Implement  short -term mitigations to isolate threat 
actor activity and prevent additional damage from the activity or pivoting into other systems. Key containment activities include: 
•
 Isolating impacted systems and network 
segments from each other and/or from 
non-impacted systems and networks. If 
this is needed, consider the mission or business needs and how to provide 
services so missions can continue during this phase to the extent possible. 
• Capturing forensic images to preserve evidence for legal use (if applicable) and 
further investigation of the incident. 
• Updating firewall filtering. 
• Blocking (and logging) of unauthorized 
accesses; blocking malware sources. 
• Closing specific ports and mail servers or other relevant servers and services. 
• Changing system admin passwords, rotating private keys, and 
service/application account secrets where 
compromise is suspected and revocation 
of privileged access. 
• Directing the adversary to a sandbox (a 
form of containment) to monitor the actor’s 
activity, gather additional evidence, and identify attack vectors. Note: this 
containment activity is limited to advanced 
SOCs with mature capabilities. 
E
nsure that the containment scope encompasses 
all related incidents and activity —especially all 
adversary activity. If new signs of compromise are 
found, return to the technical analysis step to re -
scope the incident. Upon successful containment 
(i.e., no new signs of compromise), preserve 
evidence for reference or law enforcement investigation, adjust detection tools, and move to 
eradication and recovery.

 Eradication & Recovery TLP:CLEAR 
The objective of this phase is to allow the return of normal operations by eliminating 
artifacts of the incident (e.g., remove malicious code, re- image infected systems) 
and mitigating the vulnerabilities or other conditions that were exploited. Before 
moving to eradication, ensure that all means of persistent access into the network 
have been accounted for, that the adversary activity is sufficiently contained, and 
that all evidence has been collected. This is often an iterative process. It may also involve hardening or 
modifying the environment to protect targeted systems if the root cause of the intrusion and/or init ial 
access vector is known. It is possible that eradication and recovery actions can be executed 
simultaneously. Note: coordinate with ICT service providers, commercial vendors, and law enforcement 
prior to the initiation of eradication efforts. 
Execute Eradication Plan 
Take actions to eliminate all evidence of 
compromise and prevent the threat actor from maintaining a presence in the environment. Ensure evidence has been preserved as necessary. Threat actors often have multiple 
persistent backdoor accesses into systems and 
networks and can hop back into ‘clean’ areas if eradication is not well orchestrated and/or not stringent enough. Therefore, eradication plans 
should be well formulated and coordinated before execution. If t he adversary exploited a specific 
vulnerability, initiate the Vulnerability Response Playbook below to address the vulnerability during 
eradication activities. 
Eradication A ctivities 
• Remediating all infected IT environments 
(e.g., cloud, OT, hybrid, host, and network 
systems). 
• Reimaging affected systems (often from 
‘gold’ sources), rebuilding systems from scratch. 
• Rebuilding hardware (required when the incident involves rootkits). 
• Replacing compromised files with clean versions. 
• Installing patches. 
• Resettin g passwords on compromised 
accounts. 
• Monitoring for any signs of adversary response to containment activities. 
20 See NIST SP 800 -184: Guide for Cybersecurity Event 
Recovery for additional guidance. • Developing response scenarios for threat actor use of alternative attack vectors. 
• Allowing adequate time to ensure all systems are clear of all possible threat 
actor persistence mechanisms (backdoors, etc.) as adversaries often use more than one mechanism. 
A
fter executing the eradication plan, continue with 
detection and analysis activities to monitor for any 
signs of adversary re -entry or use of new access 
methods. If adversary activity is discovered after completion of eradication efforts, contain the activity , and return to technical analysis until the 
true scope of the compromise and initial infection vectors are identified. If no new advers ary activity 
is detected, enter the recovery phase. 
Recover System(s) and Services 
Restore systems to normal operations and 
confirm that they are functioning normally. The 
main challenges of this phase are confirming that remediation has been successful, rebuilding 
systems, reconnecting networks, and recreating 
or correcting information. 
Recovery Actions20 
• Reconnecting rebuilt/new systems to 
networks. 
• Tightening perimeter security (e.g., firewall rulesets, boundary router access control lists) and zero trust access rules. 
• Testing systems thoroughly —including

It is essential for the affected department or 
agency to closely collaborate and coordinate with CISA o n each step in the IR flow chart. Some of 
the essential coordination and communication activities are defined by the numbered circles. 
Each number corresponds to a description below: 
1) Inform and Update CISA 
The FCEB agency provides situational awareness 
reports to CISA, including: 
•
 Notifying CISA within 1 hour of incident 
determination as directed by OMB M -20-
04. 
•
 Note: FCEB ICT Service providers should provide notification of cyber incidents in accordance with FCEB Agency 
Contracting Officer (CO) requirements, 
which include National Security System 
(NSS) reporting requirements.
23 
• Where applicable, notifying their 
appropriate Congressional Committees, 
their Office of Inspector General (OIG), and OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) as directed by 
OMB M -20-04. 
• Providing incident updates to CISA as 
appropriate until all eradication activities are complete or until CISA agrees with the 
FCEB agency that the incident is closed. 
• Complying with additional reporting 
requirements for m ajor incidents as 
mandated by OMB and other federal 
policy.
24 
2) CISA Provides Incident Tracking and NCISS 
Rating 
Within one hour of receiving the initial report, 
CISA provides the agency with (1) a tracking 
number for the incident and (2) a risk rating based 
23 EO 14028, Sec. 2. Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat

Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP). Regardless of the on the CISA National Cyber Incident Scoring 
System (NCISS) score.25, 26 
3) Share IOCs, TTPs, data 
The affected FCEB agency share relevant log 
data, cyber threat indicators with associated 
context (including associated TTPs, if available), 
and recommended defensive measures with CISA 
and sharing partners. Sharing additional threat information is a concurrent process throughout the containment phase. Incident updates include 
the following: 
•
 Updated scope 
• Updated timeline (findings, response 
efforts, etc.) 
• New indicators of adversary activity 
• Updated understanding of impact 
• Updated status of outstanding efforts 
• Estimation of time until containment, 
eradication, etc. 
4) CISA Shares Coordinated Cyber Intelligence 
CISA —in coordination with the intelligence 
community and law enforcement —shares related 
cyber intelligence to involved organizations. 
5) Report to Federal Law Enforcement 
The FCEB agency reports incidents to federal law 
enforcement as appropriate. 
6) CISA Determines Escalation 
CISA or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
determines if the incident warrants Cyber Unified 
Coordination Group (C -UCG) escalation, and, if 
so, recommends establishment of a C -UCG in 
accordance with the provisions of PPD- 41 § 
V.B.b.  C-UCG is the primary mechanism for 
coordination between and among federal agencies in response to a significant cyber 
internal reporting chain of the organization, CISA must 
receive the major incident report within 1 hour of major incident declaration.

partners into incident response efforts. 
7) Provide Final Incident Report 
The FCEB agency provides CISA post-incident 
updates as required. 
8) CISA Conducts Verification and Validation 
To ensure completion of recovery, CISA will 
validate agency incident and vulnerability 
response results and processes. Validation assures agencies that they are meeting baseline standards, implementing all important steps, and 
have fully eradicated an incident or vulnerability. 
For all incidents that require the use of the playbook, agencies must proactively provide completed incident response checklists and a completed incident report to close the ticket. If an 
agency is unable to complete the checklist, the 
agency will confer with CISA to ensure all 
Intergovernmental Coordination appropriate actions have been taken. CISA will 
evaluate these materials and: 
•
 Determine that the incident is adequately 
addressed, and close the CISA ticket. 
• Determine if additional response actions 
must be completed and request the 
agency complete them prior to closing the ticket. 
• Request more information, including log 
data and technical artifacts. 
• Recommend the use of CISA or other third-party incident response services. 
A
ffected FCEB entities must take CISA -required 
actions prior to closing the incident. Working with affected FCEB entities, CISA determines the 
actions, which vary depending on the nature of 
the incident and eradication. 
In a broader context, FCEB cyber defensive operations are not alone in tackling major incidents. 
Several government departments and agencies have defined roles and responsibilities and are coordinati ng and sharing across the federal government even before incidents occur. These roles and 
responsibilities can be described in terms of concurrent lines of effort (LOEs): asset response, threat response, intelligence support, and affected agency response; together these LOEs ensure a comprehensive response. Table 2 summarizes the LOEs for lead federal agencies in responding to 
cyber security incidents.

For major incidents or incidents that may become major, CISA is the “front door” for agencies for asset 
response. CISA will work with affected FCEB agencies to determine their needs, provide recommendations for services, and coordinate with other agencies (e.g., NSA) to provide a whole- of-
government response. By serving as a single coordination point, CISA can ease the burden on FCEB 
agencies by facilitating the assistance available across the government. 
Depending on the nature of events and involved organizations, FCEB agencies may also work directly 
with other LOE lead agencies in support of those LOEs. Figure 3 identifies the organizations providing 
the types of data and information that inform incident detection, analysis, and response. 
The whole- of-government roles and responsibilities are outlined in Appendix G.

VULNERABILITY RESPONSE PLAYBOOK 
One of the most straightforward and effective means for an When to use this playbook 
organization to prioritize vulnerability response and protect Vulnerabilities in scope for this 
themselves from being compromised is by focusing on playbook are those actively exploited 
vulnerabilities that are already being actively exploited in t he "in the wild," namely, any vulnerability 
wild. This playbook standardizes the high- level process that that is observed to be used by 
agencies should follow when responding to these urgent and adversaries to gain unauthorized 
high priority vulnerabilities. It is not a replacement for existing entry into computing resources . 
vulnerability management programs in place at an agency but 
inste ad builds on existing vulnerability management practices. A standardized response process 
ensures that agencies, including CISA, can understand the impact of these critical and dangerous 
vulnerabilities across the federal government. 
Vulnerabilities that t his playbook addresses could be observed by the impacted agency, CISA, industry 
partners, or others in the related mission space. Most vulnerabilities will have CVE descriptors. In other 
cases, agencies might encounter new vulnerabilities that do not yet have a CVE (e.g., zero -days) or 
vulnerabilities resulting from misconfigurations . Appendix D provides a companion checklist to track 
response activities to completion . 
Preparation 
Effective vulnerability response builds on strong vulnerability management. Ensure that effective 
vulnerability management practices are being followed.28 Such practices include building and 
maintaining robust asset management that includes inventorying: 
•  Agency -operated systems and networks,  
•  Systems and networks  that involve partne rships with other  organizations, and  
•  Systems and networks operated by others, including cloud, contractor, and 
service  provider systems.

Vulnerability Response Process 
Standard vulnerability management programs include phases for identifying, analyzing, remediating, 
and reporting vulnerabilities. Figure 4 describes the vulnerability response process in terms of standard 
vulnerability management program phases. 
Figure 4: Vulnerability Response Phases 
Identification 
Proactively identify reports of vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in the wild by monitoring threat feeds and information sources, including but not limited to: 
• CISA resources; for example: 
o CISA products, which include the weekly bulletins containing vulnerability 
summaries, and 
Note: all agencies should subscribe to CISA product 
announcements .
29 
o CISA Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22- 01, Managing 
Unacceptable Risk of Known Vulnerabilities, which is continually updated 
with vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. 
Note: subscribe to NCAS products for all BOD 22- 01 vulnerability 
updates, which are announced via Current Activities. 
• External t hreat or vulnerability feeds, such as NIST’s National Vulnerability 
Database,30 that can also show vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild outside 
FCEB agencies.

• Internal SOC monitoring and incident response, which can detect vulnerabilities 
being exploited at an agency . 
Capture additional information about the vulnerability to help with the rest of the 
response process, including the severity of the vulnerability, susceptible software versions, and IOCs or other investigation steps that can be used to determine if it 
was exploited. 
Evaluation 
First, determine whether the vulnerability exists in the environment and how critical 
the underlying software or hardware is, using methodologies such as Stakeholder -
Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) .31 Existing patch and asset 
management tools are critical and can be used to automate the detection process 
for most vulnerabilities. For actively exploited vulnerabilities, use the “rapid 
response” processes in these tools (e.g., CDM). In rare cases, such as one- off misconfigurations and 
zero- days, additional manual scans may need to be performed. Binding Operational Directives (BOD s) 
or Emergency Directives (ED s) iss ued by CISA may also list specific technical steps to evaluate 
whether a vulnerability exists . 
If the vulnerability exists in the environment, address the vulnerability itself—as described in the 
Remediation section below —and determine whether it has been exploited in the agency's environment. 
Use existing best practices to find signs of exploitation, including: 
•
 A sweep for known IOCs associated with exploitation of the vulnerability . 
• Investigation of any abnormal activity associated with vulnerable systems or services, including anomalous access attempts and behavior . 
• Completion of any detection processes in CISA directives . 
• If needed, collaboration with a third -party incident responder . 
I
f the vulnerability was exploited in the environment, immediately begin incident response activities as 
described in the Incident Response Playbook. 
At the end of the Evaluation step, the goal is to understand the status of each system in the 
environment as: 
•
 Not Affected. The system is not vulnerable. 
• Suscept ible. The system is vulnerable, but no signs of exploitation were found, and 
remediation has begun. 
• Compromised. The system was vulnerable, signs of exploitation were found, and incident 
response and vulnerability remediation has begun.

  Remediation TLP:CLEAR 
Remedi ate all actively exploited vulnerabilities that exist on or within the environment 
in a timely manner. In most cases, remediation should consist of patching. In other 
cases, the following mitigations may be appropriate: 
•  Limiting access ;  
•  Isolating vulnerable systems, applications, services, profiles, or  
other assets ; or  
•  Making permanent configuration changes.   
Ex
isting patch management tools and processes can be used to regularly patch all vulnerabilities. Use 
“rapid response” processes —As described in the Evaluation section above —in those tools for 
vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in the wild. 
In cases where patches do not exist, have not been tested, or cannot be immediately applied promptly, 
take other courses of action to prevent exploitation, such as: 
• Disabling services, 
• Reconfiguring firewalls to block access, or 
• Increasing monitoring to detect exploitation. 
Once patches are available and can be safely applied, mitigations can be removed, and patches applied. 
As systems are remediated, keep track of their status for reporting purposes. Each system should be 
able to be described as one of these categories: 
• Remediated . The patch or configuration change has been applied and the 
system is no longer vulnerable. 
• Mitigated . Other compensating controls —such as detection or access 
restriction —are in place and the risk of the vulnerability is reduced. 
• Susceptible/Compromised. No action has been taken and the system is still 
susceptible or compromised. 
Reporting and Notification 
Sharing information about how vulnerabilities are being exploited by adversaries can 
help defenders across the federal government understand which vulnerabilities are 
most critical to patch. CISA, in partnership with other federal agencies, is 
responsible for the overall security posture of the FCEB . As such, CISA needs to 
maintain awareness of the status of vulnerability response for actively exploited 
vulnerabilities.  This awareness enables CISA to help other agencies understand the impact of 
vulnerabilities and to narrow the time between disclosure and vulnerability exploitation. Agencies must 
report to CISA in accordance with Federal Incident Notification Guidelines, Binding Operational 
Directives, or as directed by CISA in an Emergency Directive.

  TLP:CLEAR 
APPENDIX E: VULNERABILITY AND INCIDENT CATEGORIES 
CISA has adopted the following common set of terms to improve clarity for Federal Civilian Executive 
Branch (FCEB) agencies for reporting to and updating CISA.39 
Incident – Per the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), as codified at 44 
U.S.C.  § 3552(b)(2): An occurrence that (A) actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, 
the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information or an information system; or (B) constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. 
Major Incident – Per the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M- 20-04 or 
subsequent memo, a major incident is either: 
1. Any incident that is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign 
relations, or the economy of the United States or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public healt h and safety of the American people.
40 Agencies should determine the level of impact of the 
incident by using the existing incident management process established in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 900-61 Revision 2, Computer 
Security Incident Handling Guide. 
or, 
2. A breach that involves personally identifiable information (PII) that, if exfiltrated, modified, deleted, 
or otherwise compromised, is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security 
interests, foreign relations, or the economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. Major incident determination is required for breaches involving PII of 100,000 or more peo ple.
41 
Breach – Per OMB Memorandum M- 17-12 or subsequent memo: The loss of control, compromise, 
unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where (1) a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information or (2) an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information for other than authorized purpose. 
Event – Per NIST SP 9 00-61 Revision 2: An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. 
Vulnerabilities: 
• Internal discovery of potential compromise leveraging a vulnerability 
• Known exploitation of vulnerability (NVD tagged entries; wide- spread public reporting; viable 
proof -of-concept  exploit released, etc.) 
39 CISA Federal Incident Reporting Requirements (draft) 
40 Using the CISA Cyber Incident Scoring System, this includes Level 3 events (orange), defined as those that are 
"likely to result in a demonstrable impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign 
relations, civil liberties, or public confidence"; Level 4 events (red), defined as those that are "likely to result in a significant impact to public health or safety, national security, economic security, foreign relations, or civil liberties"; and Level 5 events (black), defined as those that "pose an imminent threat to the provision of wide scale 
critical infrastructure services, national government stability, or the lives of US persons." 
41 The analysis for reporting a major breach to Congress is distinct and separate from the assessment of the potential 
risk of harm to individuals resulting from a suspected or confirmed breach. When assessing the potential risk of 
harm to individuals, agencies should refer to O MB M -17-12.
