 Page 1  Introduction
The Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) is offering this 
guide to participants of the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review (NCSR) and MS-
ISAC members, as a resource to assist with the application and advancement of 
cybersecurity policies. 
The policy templates are provided courtesy of the State of New York and the 
State of California. The templates can be customized and used as an outline of an 
organizational policy, with additional details to be added by the end user.  
The NCSR question set represents the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). This guide gives the correlation 
between 49 of the NIST CSF subcategories, and applicable policy and standard 
templates. A NIST subcategory is represented by text, such as “ID.AM-5. ” This 
represents the NIST function of Identify and the category of Asset Management.
For additional information on services provided by the Multi-State Information 
Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), please refer to the following page: https://
www.cisecurity.org/ms-isac/services/ . These policy templates are also mapped to 
the resources MS-ISAC and CIS provide, open source resources, and free FedVTE 
training: https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cybersecurity-
Resources-Guide.pdf .
Disclaimer:  These policies may not reference the most recent applicable NIST 
revision, however may be used as a baseline template for end users. These policy 
templates are not to be used for profit or monetary gain by any organization.
