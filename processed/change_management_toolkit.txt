 Why is a change management toolkit necessary?  
In the 21st century we are surrounded by constant innovation, technology enhancements, and a connection 
to a global network, all of which has created a new normal of perpetual change. As a way of handling the 
increased volume of change, a plethora of proven tools and  techniques have been created to aid 
individuals in managing change. As a result of these tools and techniques being globally socialized and 
tested, the necessary components for effectively managing change are known. These proven tools and 
techniques have been reviewed and curated into this toolkit which contains those most appropriate for use 
at UC Berkeley.  
 
 
 Who  is this toolkit for?  
This toolkit is designed for any individual responsible for leading a change initiative  of any size .  
 
 How to use this toolkit?  
This toolkit begins with an introduction to the importance of change management and goes over the seven 
components necessary to effectively manage change. It is organized into four main sections:  
(1) Change Management Pre -work 
(2) Manage Personal Tr ansitions (resistance)  
(3) Develop Change Plan  
(4) Implement & Monitor the Change.  
Each of these sections contain a collection of tools and techniques which organize the work needed for the 
change initiative and  they  are best followed chronologically.  
While a mul titude of tools are provided, not all tools will be necessary for every change. When considering 
which tools to use, review the scope of the change identified in the Project Charter. For large s cale 
initiatives, it is recommended that all tools be used in each section of the toolkit. For small to medium  sized  
initiatives , at a bare minimum , the following tools should be used:  
• Case for change template (page 7 ) 
• Compelling vision Interview template (page 8)  
• Change communication plan overview & template  (pages 40-41) 
• Change Readiness assessment  (page 16)  
• Manage Personal Transitions (resistance) Section  (pages 21 -29) 
• Feedback Strategy Overview & Options  (pages 37 -38)  
• Behavioral change Plan  (page  17)

3 | Page  Why Change Management ? 
As a top-ranked public research university, UC Berkeley serves as a flagship institution when it comes to our  bold and innovative  
initiatives.  Change management is often the key component in driving the  success of these ventures . As we know fro m our own 
experience, not all change  initiatives are  equally disruptive. Some will have a greater impact and be more challenging. Others may be 
barely noticeable.  
 
Change can be bucketed into  two ma in categories: Incremental and T ransformational. Incremental change is e asier to implement 
successfully. It is often b ased on the current state  in order to improve the existing  way of doing our work. It typically involves few er 
changes and affects a small  number of people.  On the other hand, Transformational change  is more difficult to implement, typically 
having  only a 30% success rate.  (Taking Stock survey by The Change Management Toolbook, February 2005 ) Why is that?  
 Things get more challenging when the change is Trans formational  because it  is designed from a future state and involves a 
fundamentally new way of doing things.  This typically involves significant  culture change  and affects a large  number . The complexity 
involved in culture change is often why it is easier to change the change than it is to change the culture.   
 Culture  is our values, beliefs, assumptions, and unwritten rules . These  shape  our behaviors and mindset as well as our performance. 
Individuals within an organization co -create the culture through conversations and by following behavioral norms . In addition to the 
overarching culture of an organization, individual subcultures often exist. Taking both of these into consideration for your particular 
initiative  is necessary when determ ining how to approach a change  for your area .  
 
Since there are many complexities involved in executing a change initiative, both change management and project management 
components are required. S ometimes change management  and project management are mistaken as  one in the same…when 
actually they are two co mplimentary yet different disciplines . Both utilize  formal  process es, tools, and techniques  to plan  for the 
change , manag e the change , and  sustain  the change . While change management focuses  on ensuring the support of the people , 
project management focuses on the work tasks to be executed . Coupled together, proactive change  management  and project 
manage ment will lead to the actualization  of the benefits of the change initiative.  
 The one common denominator to achieve success for all change initiatives is people.  According to Chip and Dan Heath, authors of 
Switch , peoples’ brains have two independent syst ems at work at all times: the rational side (is reflective, it deliberates, analyzes, 
and looks to the future), and the emotional side (is instinctive, feels pleasure and pain). Think of the rational side of the  brain as the 
Rider and the emotional side of  the brain as an Elephant. The Rider’s strength is to think and to plan. Without a plan there is no path 
to get things done. The Elephant’s strength is emotion. Without emotion there is no motivation (no energy) to get things done . 
To change behavior (our own or someone else’s) , we must do three things:  
 1. Direct the Rider – make the destination crystal clear  
The Rider has their  own issues. A  Rider likes to contemplate and analyze information before deciding on a 
direction. When a Rider isn’t sure exactly which direction to go, they lead  the Elephant in circles. Often, 
what looks like resistance is actually lack of clarity.  
 2. Motivate the Elephant –  make people feel the need for c hange  
When an individual’s  six-ton Elephant is not in agreement with the direction their  Rider wants to go, the  
Rider is going to lose. The Rider may get their  way temporarily, through close monitoring and exerting self -
control, but in the long term the Elephant will ALWAYS overpow er the Rider. Why? Self- control is an 
exhaustible resource . Often what looks like resistance is actually exhaustion.  Motivation provides the 
energy the Rider needs to maintain self -control; a lack of motivation may doom a change effort.  
 3. Shape the Path –  make  the required changes specific  
To direct the Rider and motivate the Elephant, we  need to shape the P ath by focusing the situation, 
including the surrounding environment, to make the change more likely. Being specific narrows the focus,  
so the Elephant and the Rider are more likely to stay traveling together toward the goal. Often, what looks 
like resistance is actually lack of direction.

4 | Page  What happens  if a Necessary Change Management Component  is missing?  
Industry statistics show that only 30% of organizational change initiatives are successful. For a change initiative to be regarded as successful, the desir ed objectives of the effort 
must be fully realized. The reason 70% of change initiatives fail is because organizations do not engage in effective change management. There are seven necessary components 
of change management. If any component is neglected, the result will be a less than optimal achievement of the initiatives go als. The below graphic illustrates the seven 
components required for successful change management and indicates specific consequences that occur when a component is missing. To assist y ou in proactively addressing 
each component, relevant remedies from the Toolkit are provided.

Think of the rational side of an individual’s brain as the Rider. The Rider’s strength is to think and to plan. A Rider likes to 
contemplate and analyze inform ation before deciding on a direction. When a Rider isn’t sure exactly which direction to 
go, they lead the  emotional side of an individual’s brain (the  Elephant ) in circles. Often, what looks like resistance is 
actually lack of clarity.  
 
 
Ways to Direct th e Rider - Make the Destination Crystal C lear 
 
Find the Bright Spots:  
In situations requiring change, the Rider sees problems everywhere which may result in “analysis paralysis”. To make 
progress, direct the Rider toward workable solutions  by finding  and analyzing exceptions to the current problem. These 
“bright spots ” point directly to solutions that will work in the current environment. These solutions can then be implemen ted 
as quick wins which will provide direction to the Rider and hope/motivatio n to the Elephant.  
 
Script Critical Moves:  
Decisions fall  under the purview  of the Rider. The more choices available to the Rider, the more ambiguous the path. An 
ambiguous path creates uncertainty, which makes the Elephant anxious. An anxious Elephant w ants to stay on the path of 
the “status quo” rather than change to an uncertain path. The “status quo” is comfortable and reduces the Elephant ’s anxiety. 
This means the Rider will have to constantly exert self -control to keep the Elephant on the uncertain path. To create successful 
change, ambiguous goals must be translated into concrete behavioral goals. Overtime, these defined behaviors become 
instinctive requiring less self -control from the Rider.  
 
Point to an All or Nothing Destination : 
It is necessary to provide the Rider with a near -term vivid picture of an all or nothing goal which  shows what could be possible.  
Describing a compelling destination prevents the Rider from getting lost in analysis. Instead, the Rider starts figuring out h ow 
to get to the goal. This also shows the Elephant why the journey is worthwhile, without giving the Elephant any wiggle room to rationalize failure.  
 
 
 
    CALL TO ACTION  
 Use all of the templates and tools provided in this section ( Change Management Pre -work ) to direct the Rider  in relation to your 
change initiative .

7 | Page  Case for Change Template  
The Case for Change Template is a tool that provides the Change Manager  with  one place to capture all the reasons a change needs 
to occur. Information to complete this template will be pulled from existing documents: Scope of Work, Project Charter, and 
relevant background information provided by the Sponsor.  
 
Information on this template will be used  to craft communications for each relevant  audience impacted by the change.  
 
To reveal the reasons for the change answer  the following questions.  
Background  
What current problems need to be solved?   
 
How did we get here?  
  
Current State  
Where are we now?   
 Why is what we’re doing 
currently not working?  
 
What opportunities are 
being missed?  
  
Risks of Not Taking Action  
What future problems are 
anticipated if no action is 
taken?  What is the impact 
to the or ganization ? 
  
Benefits of Taking Action  
What are the benefits of 
making the change?  
What is the impact to the 
organization ? 
  
 
Audience:  
• Tailor the Case for Change message to the audience  
• Narrow focus to 3 -5 specific (most compelling) things that will resonate with that audience

The Compelling Vision Interview Template is a tool that provides the Change Manager with probing questions to discuss with the 
Project Sponsor. Answers to these questions will be use d to craft communications for each relevant audience impacted by the 
change.  
 
To discover the Sponsor’s vision for the change discuss and answer the following questions.  
Organizational Goal  
What do we hope to 
achieve?  
  
Organizational  Benefits  
How will things be better?  
  
Impact to Stakeholders

To ensure actively engaged Sponsorship for a change initiative it is imperative to  
 
To achieve the most impactful results of a change initiative a strong and active Sponsor is imperative.  To ensure a Sponsor is actively 
engaged they must be educated on their role. The most impactful sponsors will:  
 
1. Serve as a champion for the change initiative   
2. Review and approve the Project C harter  
3. Secure resources for the project includ ing budget and team member time  
4. Regularly review project progress and performance   
5. Approve necessary adjustments based on implementation performance results  
6. Attend  project kick -offs and closing  
7. Broadly  communicate: personal commitment to change, key milestone achievements , celebrate project successes  
8. Review  pre and post implementation metrics to evaluate realized benefits of change initiative  
 The below outlines how to work with the Sponsor throughout the lifecycle of a change initiative:  
 
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIE S WHEN  WORKING WITH THE SP ONSOR  
Pre-Implementation  
• Collaborate with Project Sponsor to create  Project Charter and obtain go/no -go decision  
• Review  with the Sponsor  items listed  on the Sponsor Expectation Tool  for each phase  of the project  and o btain their 
agreement for assuming these responsibilities. Note: If the Sponsor is unable to commit to all described responsibilities , 
determine workarounds with the Sponsor for who will undertake these tasks (e.g. Steering Committee ). 
• Discuss with the Sponsor what is most critical and what can flex for the  Project  Plan  (scope, time or resources ) 
• Agree to  Sponsor’s preferred cadence and expected content for  progress updates  
• Ensure Sponsor can attend pre -implementation meeting with a personal commitment message  
 
Note: If a project has multiple Sponsors,  your goal is to ensure each Sponsor has an equal voice.  To do this, conduct a meeting 
where all sponsors and yourself are in attendance to gain alignment o f project  vision,  objectives and scope.  Then establish ongo ing 
working agreements with the use of a RACI which may be supplemented with Gradients of Agreement, Project Charter objectives 
and risk logs if necessary.  
Implementation  
• Refresh the Sponsor o n their c ommitment  by review ing items listed on Sponsor Expectation Tool  for the Implementation 
phase   
Note: If the Sponsor is unable to commit to all described responsibilities, determine workarounds with the Sponsor for who wi ll 
undertake these tasks (e.g.  Steering Committee).  
• Ensure Sponsor can attend implementation kick -off to publically acknowledge the work done to date and recognize 
individuals who were instrumental in the project’s launch 
• Based on agreed upon cadence , provide performance updates  to the Sponsor indicating project successes and 
opportunities for improvement  
• Work with the Sponsor to iterate the project as necessary until desired results are achieved  
Post -Implementation  
• Refresh the Sponsor on their commitment by reviewing items listed on Sponsor Expectation Tool for the Post -
Implementation p hase  
Note: If the Sponsor is unable to commit to all described responsibilities, determine workarounds with the Sponsor for who wi ll 
undertake these tasks (e.g. Steering Committee).  
• Ensure Sponsor can attend  project close -out to discuss lessons learned and provide official sign -off for project closure  
• Proactively discuss with Sponsor ongoing sustainability of change initiative  
Change Management Toolkit  
10 | Page Sponsor Expectation Tool  
Effective project sponsor ship is essential to the success of a change initiative. The executive sponsor is accountable for achieving the initiative’s expected realized benefits. The 
project sponsor serves as the p rimary link between the project work team and executive leadership. This involves acquiring the necessary organizational support and facilitating 
strategic decision making to ensure a successful project outcome.  
 
Throughout the lifecycle of the change ini tiative (pre -implementation, implementation, post -implementation) an effective sponsor must actively engage in the following 
activities:  
 
 
The below outlines the responsibilities of an effective sponsorship throughout the lifecycle of a change initiative:  
SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES

11 | Page Stakeholder Analysis  and Engagement Plan  Overview  
 
 
What is a Stakeholder?  
A stakeholder is a person who has a vested interest in something and who is impacted by and cares about how 
it turns out.  Refer to your COPIS,  created during the process  mapping phase of the  project, as it provides a 
starting list of stakeholders.  
 Potential Stakeholders : 
• People who can exert influence or pressure on your change  
• People responsible for creating your change  
• People who can choose to use or not use the results of your change  
• People who will ultimately benefit from the work of your change  
  
Stakeholders Types :
 
 
   

Change Management Toolkit  
12 | Page  
Identify each of your stakeholders into their appropriate types : 
 
List Your Allies  
 
List Your Opponents  
 
List Your Fellow Travelers  
 
List Your Neutrals  
 
List Your Adversaries  
 
 
  
Change Management Toolkit  
13 | Page Strategy for engaging each Stakeholder Type:  
Once your stakeholders are identified into the appropriate type, it is a best practice to prioritize stakeholder 
engagement in the following order:   
1) Allies,  
2) Opponents  
3) Fellow Travelers  
4) Neutrals  
5) Adversaries  
 This prioritization strategy ensures the highest level of ongoing support for the change effort.  
 Stakeholder Approaches:  
Listed below are various approaches  for each S takeholder Type to e ither maintain or shift each stakeholders ’ 
level of commitment.   
  Allies (High Agreement/High Trust)  
An approach  for Maintaining Agreement and Trust  
Goal: Affirm agreement  
1. Reaffirm the quality of the relationship  
2. Acknowledge any doubts and vulnerability you have with respect to your vision and project  
3. Discuss their issues or concerns with your project  
4. Ask them for advice and support  
5. Achieve understanding  on their role and responsibilities  
6. Confirm their commitment to support your project  
  Fellow Travelers (High Agreement/Low Trust)  
An approach  for Maintaining Agreement and Increasing Trust  
Goal: Build trust  
1. Reaffirm agreement by reiterating the value and importance of their support of your project  
2. Acknowledge any caution that exists  
3. Make it clear you are not expecting them to get acti vely involved  
4. Ask them how they would like to be updated on the project going forward  
 
 
Opponents (Low Agreement /High Trust)  
An approach  for Shifting Commitment  and Maintaining Trust  
Goal: Build agreement  
1. Reaffirm the quality of the relationship  
2. Identify their particular skills and talents and how these connect to your project  
3. State your position (case for change, vision for change, benefits to them)  
4. State what you think their position is in a neutral way  
5. Extend a personal invitation for them to get involved with your project  
6. Engage in problem -solving so that you build something together  
7. Confirm their commitment to support your project  
 
Change Management Toolkit  
14 | Page Adversaries (Low Agreement/Low Trust)  
An approach  for Shifting Agreement and Increasing Trust  
Goal: Minimize threat to your project  
1. Estimate the impact on your project if this person is not on board  
2. Identify individuals who can educate you about this person, their issues and concerns  
3. State your position (case for change, vision for change, benefits to them)  
4. Ask questions that respectfully uncover root cause of their resistance  
5. State what you think their position is in a neutral way  
6. Identify your own contribution to the lack of trust that exists  
7. End the meeting w ith your plans and no demands  
8. If you are going to go  around them or over them, tell them your plans  
9. Let go; the more you try to convert and pressure them, the more entrenched they will 
become in their position  
  Neutrals (Unknown Agreement and Unknown Trust)  
An approach  for Determining Agreement and Level of Trust  
Goal: Educate and determine their position 
1. State your position (case for change, vision for change, benefits to them)  
2. Ask where they stand 
3. Ask what it would take for them to support your project  
4. Extend a personal invitation for them to get involved with your project

To achieve  successful implementation, change s in individual  behavior s are  required.  Behavioral change s cannot be left to chance; 
they  must be proactively planned for.  
 
A behavioral change plan defines what  success looks like, so it can be measured after  the change is implemented. The most 
succ essful behavioral change plans look at the:  
• Behaviors that need to change  
• Systems, processes , and procedures that need to be in place to ensure success  
• Other preparation acti vities required (e.g. training)  
• Consequences necessa ry to sustain behavioral change  
 
Using the questions below, a  behavioral change plan  is created by the team , for the team , to ensure sustained behavioral change . 
The leader creates an  initial draft of the plan which is distributed to the team to obtain feedback. T he team’s  feedback is then 
incorporate into a revise d plan in order to  achieve  buy- in prior to implementation.

19 | Page Team Communication  Overview  
 
To achieve successful implementation, ongoing team communication is required. Communication must be proactively planned for  
and scheduled.  
 
During times of change it is not uncommon for leaders to experience the following frustrating scenario : 
 
As the manager, I feel like I have communicated clearly and f requently about the current changes, the business plan to 
address the changes,  and the need to move forward. However, the large majority of my team seems confused about any 
possible changes and at least one staff member has blamed me for not giving the staff enough information.  
 
Leaders often wonder… Why does this happen?  
We know from brain imaging research, that we can’t think cognitively very well when we are emotional. The deductive reasoning  
area of our brain actually shrinks! When anxiety and fear are cumulative, our ability to function actually becomes impaired. This is 
true for us and for our employees. As supervisors, not only do we need to take steps to address our own emotions around the 
change, but we need to provide resources, be available to our  employees, and role model self -care  
 
The reason we communicate extensively during change is to ensure that everyone is hearing the same message, understands the 
new direction, and how their work and behaviors will be impacted by it. Something to keep in mind is…when people are under 
stress , their ability to process information is reduced by 80%.

Change Management Toolkit  
20 | Page Team Communication Plan  
The goal of change communication is to facilitate sustained realization of the change goal by recommitting people along the w ay. 
Keep in mind as you are communicating that people have a limited capacity to absorb information under stress. This is why you 
simply cannot communicate too much.  
Type of Meeting  Purpose of Meeting  What to Communicate  
Initial Group 
Meetings  • Listen and encourage dialogue  specific 
to the proposed change  
• Deliver change  message  
o Case for change  
o Vision for the future  
o Explain how the team’s work will be impacted by the larger 
organizational change  
o What is/isn’t changing  
• Address issues, concerns and ideas  
• Review initial draft of the team specific 
Behavioral Change P lan  
• Explain  next steps:  
o Upcoming 1:1s  
o Creation of work team to 
provide feedback on 
Behavioral Change Plan  
• Reference Best Practices for 
Communication*  
 When building commitment , begin  by reiterating  the 
global organizational message about the change ( both 
Case and Vision). Then provide specific information about how this change will impact the  team’s work . This helps 
those affected learn and understand what actions are 
required of them to actualize the change  and achieve its 
desired outcome s. 
 
Throughout the lifecycle of the change, communicate 
constantly and continue to provide opportunities for the 
team to raise concerns and provide input. During time s of 
change, leaders often feel they have communicated 
excessively,  while employees believe  they haven’t 
received enough communication. It is critical for leaders 
to understand that during time s of change employees are 
under a great deal of stress. Physiologically , stress reduces 
people’s ability to process information by up to 80%. Therefore, i f you think you have communica ted enough, 
communicate 10X more an d then it may actually be 
enough.  
 
In addition to frequent communication,  it is also 
important to u se both group and 1:1 meetings as an 
opportunit y to ascertain each individual’s  level of 
commitment  for the proposed change . For those who 
aren’t fully committed , use 1:1 meetings to 
discover/discuss what would move the person  further  
towards acceptance.  
 1:1 conversations also provide an opportunity for the 
leader  to continually  assess each team member’s  
emotional stage . Once  the stage is  identified, u se the 
information provided in The Change Process –  Indicators & 
Strategies (Kubler -Ross) , to provide the appropriate 
support  needed .
 
 Regularly 
scheduled  
1:1 Meetings  • Surface and address individual issues  
related to the proposed change  
• Check -in on each individual’s 
commitment  to the change  
• Reference Best Practices for 
Communication*  
 
Ongoing Group 
Updates  • Modifications  to the proposed change  
• Update on the progress of  the 
Behavioral Change Plan  
• Reference Best Practices for 
Communication*  
 
 
*Best Practices for Communication  
• Communicate often  
• Support the change with a positive, yet realistic  attitude  
o Do raise concerns to the level above you  
o Don’t criticize the proposed change to the level below you  
• Be concise/consistent/use simple language  
• Be honest about what is/is not known 
• Show caring and empathy  
• Listen more than talk, acknowledge feelings  
• Be aware of tone, e.g. pronouns (“we” NOT “you”)  
• Provide opportunity for dialog, ask for input and feedback  (to ensure commitment to the proposed change)  
o Ask… “What additional information do you need?”  
o Ask…  “How can we best set you up for success?”  
• Using the information provided in The Change Process –  Indicators & Strategies (Kubler -Ross) , continuously assess each  individual ‘s 
emotional stage a nd provide them the suggested support

22 | Page To Change Behavior – Motivate the Elephant 
Think of the emot ional  side of an individual’s brain as the Elephant . The Elephant’s strength is emotion. Without 
emotion there is no motivation (no energy) to get things done.  Highly successful change efforts find ways to help 
others see the problems/solutions in ways tha t influence emotions. Most people think successful change happens in 
this order: analyze  – think – change. In fact, most successful change actually happens in this order: see  – feel – change.  
 
When an individual’s six -ton Elephant is not in agreement with the direction their Rider wants to go, the Rider is going to lose. The 
Rider may get their way temporarily, through close monitoring and exerting self -control, but in the long term the Elephant will 
ALWAYS overpower the Rider. Why? Self -control is an exhau stible resource . Often what looks like resistance is actually exhaustion.  
Motivation provides the energy the Rider needs to maintain self -control; a lack of motivation may doom a change effort.  
 
 
Ways to Motivate the Elephant (make people feel the need for  change)  
 
Find the Feeling   
Knowing something is not enough to cause change. When people fail to change, it is usually NOT due to a lack of 
understanding. Analytical arguments don’t motivate; emotions motivate. Eliciting negative emotions can motivate 
quick/specific actions, but elic iting positive emotions is a better approach when broadening/building actions are needed for 
the change effort.   
Shrink the Change   
When a task seems too big, or a journey too long, the Elephant becomes overwhelmed and resists. Elephants get easily 
demora lized and they need a lot of reassurance. One way to make the change less daunting is to help the Elephant create 
impact and feel closer to the finish line by proactively planning for quick wins and creating easy to reach milestones. The 
Elephant finds it more motivating to be partly finished with a longer journey than to be at the beginning of a shorter journey. 
Quick wins and easy to reach milestones, create a sense of progress and immediate impact and make the change  effort seem 
less daunting. These  crea te feelings of hope and increase the Elephant’s confidence that the change can succeed. Feelings of 
hope and confidence are motivating to the Elephant.   
Grow Your People  
Any pursuit, event one that is ultimately successful, is going to involve failure and the Elephant really, really, hates to fail. 
Failure triggers a “flight” instinct. To keep the Elephant motivated, adopt a learning frame to assist the Elephant in having  a 
growth mindset. Lasting change is rarely a smooth journey. More often, it is exper ienced as three steps forward and two 
steps back. Create the expectation that while the overall mission will NOT fail, failures are expected along the way. The 
Elephant will persevere if it expects the journey will be hard before it is easy, and if it perc eives falling down as learning rather 
than as failing.  
 
 
 
    CALL TO ACTION  
 
Use all of the templates and tools provided in this section ( Manage Personal T ransitions - Resistance) to motivate the Elephant  in 
relation to your change initiative.

23 | Page Transition Model  (Bridges)  
As a leader of change, it is important to recognize how change will impact the emotional experience of an employee.  One way to 
understand change is in terms of situation and transition.  
Change  is situational. It is a disruption of  expectations (e.g. new worksite, manager, roles, policy, processes, technology, etc.). Every 
change, even the most longed for , requires leav ing something behind and letting go.  
Transition is psychological.  It is the process people must go through to come to terms with the new situation. It requires letting go 
of something, grieving in some way, experiencing feelings of loss and processing tho se effectively in order to move forward. This 
requires time and, since it is experienced internally, it may be invisible or hard to observe in others.  
The transition process has three stages:  
 
The work of  Endings is letting go of the way things have been, including acknowledging what will end and what will be retained in 
the new.  
The work of the Neutral Zone is finding clarity amid confusion. This is the space between the old familiar way and the future state. It 
is filled with both danger and opportunity. It feels like being between trapezes, where there is nothing to hold onto.  
The work of Beginnings  is managing the ambiguity of starting something new. It requires understanding why the old way had to 
change, hav ing a picture in mind of the future state , a plan for getting there, and a role in the new state.  
  

Change Management Toolkit  
24 | Page Change Process Model (Kubler -Ross)  
Another way to understand change is Elizabeth Kubler -Ross’ Grief Cycle Model (1969)  illustrated here . This model, originally used to 
explain an individual’s bereavement change journey, is also widely used to explain the emotional responses  people experience 
during other forms of change.  
 
 
The model identifies an individual’s  emotional journey over time. As a leader , you must support people differently at each of the 
different emotional stages.  The stages of change  are...  
• Denial  
• Anger  
• Bargaining  
• Depression  
• Acceptance  
While the journey appears sequential, i n real life people move through the sta ges at different rates.  Some individuals go through the 
stages in a rather linear fashion . They seem to zip right though the resistance parts of the journey, moving rather quickly straight to 
acceptance.  
Others may  get stuck for a period of time at a particular stage . They have trouble “letting go” causing them to get stalled along the 
way.  
When  multiple change s are staggered or simultaneously occur in an organization during a short period of time,  it is not uncommon 
for an individual to revert back  to an earlier stage as the next wave of change hits.  
Interestingly, all individuals tend to  go through th e same emotional journey whether they perceive the change as a positive 
(something they’ve chosen) or as a negative (something that has been thrust upon them). P eople often wish they could skip the 
resistance part of the journey;  they can’t. They must go through each of the stages  in order to let go of the past  and move forward  
into the future . 
  

Change Management Toolkit  
25 | Page Change Process Model – Indic ators & Strategies  (Kubler -Ross)  
As a leader, you will notice your employees moving  through the stages of change at different rates . To set your team up for success, 
it will be necessary  to be attentive to the emotional stage  each individual is experiencing and adjust your support accordingly.  In 
addition to being a resource for your team, you will want to use the strategies below to provide support yourself as well.  
 
Listed below are behavioral indicators along with various  strategies to use at each  stage to help you generate a plan to provide 
individual support . Recognizing and proactively responding to the needs of each employee at each stage will help mitigate resistance 
and provide momentum to move employees forward thro ugh the change journey.  
 
Denial Stage  
You See:  
• Indifference  
• Disbelief  
• Going through the motions  
• Avoidance/Withdrawal  
 
You Hear:  
• Silence  
• “It’s OK”   
• “It will never happen”  
• “It won’t affect me”  
• “All we need to do is…”  Strategies:  
• Provide frequent, consistent information about the change; explain what to expect and actions to adjust  
• Clarify what is changing and what is not  
• Place change in broader context  
• Address rumors and misinformation; confront without threatening
 
 
Resistance (Anger/Bargaining/Depression) Stage  
You See:  
• Anger/Hostility  
• Complaining  
• Glorifying Past  
• Skepticism  
• Accidents  
• Lack of concentration  
 You Hear:  
• It’s unfair”  
• “It doesn’t make sense”  
• “I’m leaving”  
• Asking for more detail  
 Strategies:  
• Acknowledge and legitimize feelings, don’t justify the need for change now  
• Clarify case for change  
• When old issues resurface, don’t choke or 
punish them  
• Give more information about the change; tell 
people where they stand  
• Establish firm expectations  
• Determine knowledge/skill gaps to prepare 
for the change  
• Provide exposure and opportunity  to 
influence participation

27 | Page Core  Values  Exercise  
One way to effectively manage resistance to change is to tap back into your own core values and find a way to anchor one or more 
of them to some aspect of the change. At the time a change is announced, the Core Values Exercise tool may be used proactively to 
create emotional resonance and assist  you in supporting the change  from a place of authenticity . If the change is already underway, 
the tool may be used reactively  to help you mitigate internal resistance  and continue moving you forward through the change 
journey.  
 For example:  
• If one of your Core Values  is Creativity, and you believe the change will bring you more opportunities to be creative in your 
job (doing less repetitive/routine work ) then this would contr ibute to you supporting the change.  
• If one of your Core Values is Responsibility, you may be able to tie supporting the change efforts to what it means to you to 
be “responsible” at work, and be able to support the change authentically from that perspective.  
 
Circle your top 5 values from the list below. Add any that are missing that  are meaningful to you.  
 
Authenticity  Harmony  
Balance  Health  
Commitment  Honesty  
Compassion  Humor  
Concern for others  Integrity  
Courage  Intelligence  
Creativity  Joyfulness  
Education  Kindness  
Empathy  Knowledge

28 | Page Best Practices for Leading Change  – What to Do  
Provide information, what you know, what you don’t, when to expect updates. – Employees need all available 
information to make realistic assessments and effective plans. Share what informatio n you  have  when you have it: what 
is changing, what is not, what is known , what is unknown, when to expect updates.  
 
Display a positive attitude – As the leader , you are in a positon of great influence. In a sense you are your team’s North 
Star. Even if you are not yet fully onboard with the change, d isplay  to your team  an attitude that is unbiased  and 
welcoming of feedback.  
 
Stay connected to your team –  Focus  on team goals, foster support , monitor function ing, and celebrate achievements.  
 
Re-recruit people  – Reiterate to each team member their value, and your desire to have them remain on the team and 
support the change.  
 
Surface issues and concerns  – Show empathy; help employees reframe their personal response to the change so they 
can effectively manage their own personal resistance  
 
Provide more structure – Define short -term objectives, tim e frames, priorities, and standards to help your team regain 
its equilibrium  
 
Protect quality and customer service  – Service standards must remain high . 
 
Delegate – Continue delegat ing work tasks while remaining mindful of each em ployee’s emotional stage and providing  
them  relevant support.  
 
Empower  – As appropriate, give employees more influence in day to day decisions. Determine the appropriate level of 
authority to assign by considering an employee’s current emotional stage, level of experience, capability, and the task 
itself.  
 
Raise the bar  – Provide challenging assignments  and c oach employees to grow and develop their  skills  
 
Recognition  – During change  it is especially  important to show appreciation and provide acknowledgement for work 
well done . 
 
2-way  communication – Be honest about what you can’t say or don’t know , and b e open to hearing feedback.  
 
Inform/update higher management  – Provide  candid feedback  on the change as it relates to the work and its impact on 
the people. This ensures leadership has the information  need ed to make informed decisions  
 
Practice the 4 Vs : 
This is not a change strategy by itself, rather a piece of a larger strategy, or a tool, to use at the  very moment the change 
goes live .  
• Visibility  – Be visible, available and interested in your employees during this time. Brief check -ins will leave 
employees feeling supported and valued.  
• Variability  – Allow for varying personal reactions (see Kubler- Ross  grief cycle model, pages 17 -19) and give 
employees more flexibility at work to take care of themselves.  
• Ventilation – allow opportunities (both formal and informal)  for employees to tell their stories , compare their 
reactions, and express their feelings . Productivity may decrease initially; however, allowing ventilation can 
expedite getting back to a focus on work.  
• Validation – say thank you and acknowledge employees for their contributions. Special recognitions and verbal 
encouragements go a long way in c hallenging times.  
 
 Adapted from Ewins & Windby   
Change Management Toolkit  
29 | Page Best Practices for Leading Change  – What NOT to Do  
Don’t censor information or hold back until everything  is known  
Employees need all available information to make realistic assessments and effective plans. Share what informatio n you 
do have, when you have it even if the information you have is not complete.  
 
Don’t express cynicism  
Employees look to you as a role model and need your support and constructive guidance .  
 Don’t be unrealistically positive  
Don’t be Pollyanna… acknowledge when things are difficult.   
 
Don’t isolate yourself  
Employees need access to you to feel supported. Use employees’ cues to know when to become more involved and 
when to back off.  
 
Don’t expect employees to all react the same way a t the same time  
Employees respond to the same situation differently  (see Kubler -Ross grief cycle model, pages 17 -19). 
 
Don’t enable resistance  
Enabling is an action you take that protects the employee from consequences of his/her actions and actually helps the 
employee to not move through the change process. Examples of enabling include:  
• Covering Up  
Providing alibis, making excuses or even doing someone’s work for them rather than confronting the issue that 
they are not meeting expectations.  
• Rationalizing  
Developing reasons why the person’s behavior is understandable or acceptable.  
• Withdrawing/Avoiding  
Avoiding contact with the person whose behav ior is problematic.  
• Blaming  
Blaming yourself for the person’s continued challenging behavior or getting angry at the individual for not trying 
hard enough to improve their  behavior or to get help.  
• Controlling  
Taking responsibility for the person by significantly changing their environment or trying to minimize the impact 
by moving them  to a less important job.  
• Threatening   
Saying that you will take action (i.e. formal disciplinary action) if the employee doesn’t improve, but not following through.

31 | Page To Change Behavior – Shape the Path 
To direct the Rider and motivate the Elephant, it is important  to shape the Path by focusing the situation  and its 
surrounding environment. Without a specific plan there is no clear path to get things done. Being specific narrows the 
focus, so the Elephant and the Rider are more likely to stay traveling together toward the goal. Often, what looks like 
resistance is actually lack of direction.  
 
 
Ways to Shape the Path – Make the Required Changes Specific  
 
Tweak the Environment  
What looks like a person problem is often a situation problem. Simple environmental tweaks may make the journey easier 
which can lead to dramatic behavioral changes because less self -control is required to achieve the result. Take a look at the 
situation a nd determine ways to make the right behaviors a little bit easier (those that support the change) and the wrong 
behaviors a little bit harder (those that maintain the status -quo).  
 
Build Habits  
Think of habits as behavioral autopilot. Habits  allow behavio rs to happen without the Rider having to take charge and exert 
self-control. Since self -control is an exhaustible resource, the more behaviors that can occur without tapping into it the better. 
Behavioral habits can be stitched into the environment through the use of action triggers. An action trigger initiates a 
preloaded decision to engage in a certain behavior. When people pre -decide, they turn the control of their behavior over to 
the environment, and an instant habit is created.  
 
One type of action tr igger is linking two behaviors together. For example, a person who drinks coffee each morning can 
connect this behavior to writing a to -do-list for the day. A more elaborate action trigger is the use of a checklist. It educate s 
the Rider on what’s best and indicate s the ironclad right way to do something. In complex environments, it can help 
individuals avoid blind spots and provide insurance against over confidence that can lead to mistakes.  
 
Rally the Herd  
In ambiguous situations, individuals  look to othe r people for cues about how to behave. People  are incredibly sensitive to the 
norms and expectations of the communities they  are in, and instinctively try to fit in with their  peer group. The Elephant looks 
to the herd for cues about how to behave especial ly in unfamiliar or ambiguous situations. Because behavior is contagious, 
publicize situations where the herd has embraced the right behavior and intentionally create language to articulate what is 
different and better about the change. These steps will se rve to unleash the change by rallying the support of early adopters 
in swaying others in the community to get on board.

32 | Page Implementation S trate gies 
When implementing change there are three  strategies to consider: P ilot, Big Bang, or Phased Big Bang .  
 
Pilot : Choose a Pilot implementation , if you are testing a new innovative idea, possible growth strategy , or very risky core business 
operation. By implementing a pilot this will help the project team to analyze results, dete rmine ROI and identify areas of risk and/or 
improvement before a full implementation roll -out. Ultimately, the reason for pilot testing is to test quickly and iterate as  necessary.  
 Big Bang : Choose a B ig Bang implementation for initiatives that align to strategic business priorities driven from the highest levels  of 
leadership.  A Big Bang is best used for  rolling out a new system or strategy that requires campus -wide adoption and is effective 
immediately. The implementation typically occurs  all at once , and mass communication s are  used to update and inform employees.  
 Phased Big Bang : A Phased Big Bang approach is used to chunk the implementation roll-out into cohorts . This approach aims to 
reduce operational risks associated with ramp up time or scalabi lity and gives the project team the opportunity to iron out any 
difficulties identified . Groups who are selected for the first cohort must be willing to provide necessary feedback and be strong 
adopters of the strategy. As each new cohort  rolls -out, implem entation is expected to get easier as it gains more  positive  employee 
traction.  
 
Example:  
Cohort 1:  Roll-out – January 1  
Cohort  2  Roll-out - March 1  
Cohort 3  Roll-out – June 1

Change Management Toolkit  
33 | Page Risk Assessment  Template  
The purpose of risk assessment  is to identify potential problems before they occur . This is to ensure risk mitigation activities can be 
planned and implemented as needed across the lifecycle  of the change initiative . Use the following Risk Assessment Template to 
identify and address any issues t hat may hinder the projects desired outcomes .  
 
How to use the Risk Assessment Template:  
1. List and describe the risk associated with the change initiative  
2. Indicate the risk category : 
o Compliance - Adheres to laws, regulations, and policies  
o Efficiency – Proficiently achieving the objectives of the process  
o Financial – Efficient stewardship of funds  
o Health & Safety –  Promotes a healthy community and safe working environment  
o Information – Supports accuracy and reliability of data  
o Operational – Productive use of resources  
o Reputational – Impacts university’s brand 
o Security – Protect and secure information to prevent exploi tation, corruption, or loss of data  
o Strategic – Supports a campus, unit, or collaboration level objective  
3. Use the below Risk Assessment Matrix  to identify the appropriate risk approach  
 
4. For each risk identified with an approach of either Mitigate  or Avoid  indicate how the risk will be addressed

35 | Page Success Metrics  Overview  
When implementing a change in the workplace , it is imperative to have success metrics. Success metrics can be defined as the 
metrics that help leadership to assess the overall health and achievement of the change . Success metrics ar e useful across all levels 
of the organization as they evaluate, indicate, and measure performance based on the objectives set forth by the change  initiative . 
From a leadership standpoint, they  help leaders understand the initiatives  overall impact . Many o f these metrics include specifics on  
how many employees  are affected and how the change has impacted  their  engagement.  
 
The below graphic shows the cycle of determining and tracking success metrics for the change initiative .  
 
Success Metrics are quantitative  data obtained from:  
• Customer Satisfaction  
• Financial Performance (e.g. cost, revenue)  
• Operational Performance (e.g. rework, lead time, handoffs)  
• Product and/or Service Quality (e.g. quality, defects, volume, 
frequency)  
• Public Outreach (e.g. number of people impacted)  
• Supplier Performance (e.g. reliability, durability)  
 
Feedback is qualitative data obtained from:  
• 1:1 Meetings  
• Team Meetings  
• Focus Groups  
• Surveys  
• Open Comment Box  (Live URL available 24/7)  
• Incentivized feedback  
Success metrics  and feedback  are used to understand the current 
landscape of the change effort through all stages of the initiative. Quantitative data can be disseminated via metrics reporting . 
Qualitative data must be combined and grouped into common themes in order to bubble up relevant information. For transparency, 
all impacted employees must  be provided the outcome of the metrics  and feedback  provided to leadership.  
 
• Pre-Implementation  – gather success metrics  
Use the time before implementation occurs to hypothesize possible success metrics  tied to the change objectives . These 
metrics should be defined before Day 1 of the Pilot, Big Bang, or Phased Big Bang kick-off.  
• Implementation – Pilot , Big Bang, or Phased Big Bang  Kick -off 
The first three months is the learning curve period. During this time, expect many  of the metrics to be volatile. Typically , 
after 3 months the data will start to normalize and a true pattern of the  strategy’s  performance will emerge . 
• Post Implementation –  monitor , control success , and promote continuous  improvement  
By the end of the testing period the change strategy should now be evergreen in your departme nt. To ensure its continued 
success, monitor and keep all success metrics visible to the users at hand. Update these metrics with  a particular cadence 
(weekly, bi -weekly , etc) and have conversations around achievements  or improvement opportunities as they arise 
throughout the year. Refer to  Monitor Metrics  for Continuous Improvement . 
 
Employees have a responsibility to the campus to be accountable  for the changes made year over year. Ongoing monitoring of 
metrics ensure s a feedback loop for continuous improvement . This feedback helps leadership to understand that no one process is 
forever optimal. By maintaining the conversation of  metrics, we can collectively celebrate success while continually explor ing 
improvements togeth er.

37 | Page Feedback Strategy  Overview  
When implementing a change, create a feedback strategy for each phase of the change :  
 
 
 Pre-implementation  – used to understand existing concerns  
 
 Implementation  – illustrates how the implemented change immediately impacted 
the identified concerns and helps determine if iteration is necessary  
 
 Post -implementation  – used to monitor and control the implemented change and 
fosters continuous improvement  
 
 
 
 The data collected in each phase allows the Project Team to understand the successes and ongoing opportunities of the roll -out. This 
information is communicated t o the Leadership Team to enable informed decisions.  The following graphic illustrates the elements of 
the feedback strategy .

 Open Comment Box  
An open text box that lives on a dedicated 
project specific web  page or a department’s 
intranet. This mechanism  is best suited for post -
implementation where the feedback goes 
directly to the process owner for continuous 
improvement.

40 | Page Change Communications Plan  Overview  
The Change C ommunications  Plan is a tool that provides the Change Manager with a high level messaging  plan for 
informing important stakeholders  throughout the lifecycle of a  change project.  These communications are used to 
create awareness and  provide key information to keep stakeholders updated appropriately.  
 
Messaging around a change is often complex.  There can be numerous stakeholders with varying interests requiring 
message s to be framed differently. For this reason, i t is important to have the right people in the room when drafting 
the Change C ommunications  Plan to ensure a holistic approach when de termining : the audience (who) , messaging  
(what) , and communication delivery method  (how) .  
 Work Session Participants :  
• Change Manager  
• Project Manager  
• Project Leadership Team (Sponsor, Project Leads, Process Owners , etc.)  
 Work Session Format:  
• 2-Hr Meeting  (add additional meetings if needed)  
o Include all required participants  
• Edit Process Improvement  Communications  Plan in real- time  
o LCD Projector  & Laptop   
o Projec t Process Improvement  Communications Plan template  (see Pages 3 5-38)  
 Instructions  for Change Communications Plan Template :  
1. Using the provided template, work session participants will complete Sections 1 & 2 together to the best of their 
ability. Keep  in mind this is a working  document and additional items can be check marked throughout the 
working session .  
2. Begin to complete Section 3 by referring to the first identified audience in Section 1 and complete the template 
for all messages related to that particular audience.  
3. Cont inue to follow Step 2 until all audiences have been addressed in the Section 3’s plan .  
4. Once complete , the Communications Plan is managed and owned by the Change Manager and/or the 
Communications Leads who will ensure the execution of these messages.  
 Instructions for Change Communications Brief Template :  
There are often  numerous stakeholders with varying interests that requir e messages about the change initiative to be 
framed differently. The Change Manager will use the completed Change Communications Plan  to create Change 
Communications Brief s for each determined communication.  
 Often in small to medium sized change initiatives, the Change Manager is expected to craft the messaging themselves. Use the Change Communications Brief Template  as a thinking tool to outline your messages.  
 In the event that you are able to partner with a Communications Specialist , provide the completed Change 
Communications Brief Template s to them for reference as they prepare messaging for you.

When any forward movement towards  the change  is noticed, it must be reinforced . Look for bright spots, no matter 
how tiny, and reward them. Reinforcement of bright -spot  behaviors creates a snowball  effect.  As people begin to act in 
a new way, and are recognized for this new behavior, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to dislike the way they 
are acting. As they act differently, they begin to think of themselves differently, and as their identity evol ves, this 
reinforces the new way of doing things. At some point, the momentum shifts from resisting the change to supporting it. This i s how 
small change s, when reinforced, snowball into big change s.

Once implementation o ccurs  begin tracking the success metrics identified in the 
Success Metrics Template. At this point, these metrics  are used to gauge  a 
pulse on adoption, engagement, buy- in, and to obtain an overall reaction to  
the change . The Project Manager and Change Manager will collaborate 
to create  communications with  a particular cadence that disseminate s 
both the quantitative and qualitative data being tracked.  
 
The graphic to the right shows the cycle of how tracking success 
metrics  contributes to a continuous improvement feedback loop.  
 For project transparency, ensure all impacted employees are also 
provided with a communication of the outcome of the metrics and 
feedback that are shared with  leadership.  
  
 
Success Metrics are quantitative data obtained from:  
• Adoption rate  
o User reach (e.g. numbe r of people 
impacted)  
o Speed of adoption  
o Number of exceptions made  
• Financial Performance (e.g. cost, revenue)  
• Customer Satisfaction  
• Usage and utilization reports   
o Operational Performance (e.g. rework, 
lead time, handoffs)  
o Product and/or Service Quality (e. g. 
quality, defects, volume, frequency)  
o Supplier Performance (e.g. reliability, durability)  
• Employee Engagement  
o Turnover rate (number of people
