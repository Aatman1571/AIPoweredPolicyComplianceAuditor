2. Document purpose This document outlines the change management policy expected to be adhered to by all employees Timico. 3. Change management policy summary The primary objective of Change Management (CM) is to enable changes to be made, with minimal or no disruption to the services we provide to our customers. Change Management will work in conjunction with other Timico policies related to ITIL and IT Service Management (ITSM). The goals of the Timico Change Management Policy include establishing a standard process for requesting, planning, communicating, approving, implementing and reporting changes to our Services. The owner of this policy is of the Timico Chief Operating Officer. 4. Key change management policy steps    5. Roles Roles Description Change Requestor Anyone who wants to raise a request for change (RFC) Change Owner Person who ensures the assessment, prioritisation, scheduling communication and delivery of the change Change Implementer Person who creates, builds, tests and deploys the change Change Management Process Manager Person who administers the change process, ensuring all necessary process steps are completed and improvements are raised, when necessary Change Approver The person / group who approves the change(s) CAB (Change Advisory Board) / ECAB (Emergency Change Advisory Board) The group/body who exist to support the authorisation of change and to assist Change Management in the assessment, prioritisation and scheduling of change, resolving priority conflicts.

6. Change types Change Type Definition Technical Approval prior to CAB CAB Submission Deadline Standard A routine change that is low risk, relatively common, and follows a pre-defined procedure. Customer approval is still required.  For a Normal change to be upgraded to a standard change, it must have been completed successfully three times as a normal change and the procedure documented. The creation of the standard template requires approval by the change manager. No No 
Normal A change to an existing service, system, application or infrastructure component with potential impact which may require CAB approval before being implemented. Yes 3 hours before CAB for high risk changes only Emergency A change that must be implemented as soon as possible, for example, to resolve a major Incident, implement a security patch or to prevent an imminent failure. Yes Emergency CAB required

7. Change risks and impact Change Risks When assessing a change, a risk assessment is undertaken using the following criteria: High: • Previous change has been made and was not successful • Complex implementation or back-out plans • Novel technology, not previously implemented Medium: • Previous similar changes have occasionally been problematic • Some complexity to implementation or back-out plans • Standard technology utilized in a non-standard application Low: • Previous similar changes have always been successful • Simple implementation or back-out plans • Standard technology used in a BAU context Customer impact analysis When assessing a change, an impact assessment is undertaken using the following criteria: High: • The proposed change poses significant impact to the customer(s) or internal systems in the form of loss of service or serious performance degradation for an extended period • Multiple customers or internal departments suffer loss or degraded service during the change window Medium: • The proposed change poses an impact to the customer(s) or internal systems in the form of reduced resiliency, redundancy or capacity • A single customers or internal department suffers loss or degraded service during the change window Low: • The proposed change has no impact to the customer(s) or internal system systems

8. Changed approval For each change type the following approval matrix needs to be adhered to:  Change Type Technical Approval Customer CAB / ECAB Standard No Yes No Normal Yes Yes Risk related Emergency Yes Yes Yes   Technical approval Technical approval must be given by a higher skilled engineer or peer (of the technology / technologies related to the change) of the engineer implementing the change. If the engineer planning and implementing the change has no reviewer of an equivalent or higher skillset, then the change must be set as a high risk and assessed by the CAB / ECAB. Customer approval Individual customer approval (for changes related to one customer only) must only be accepted from an authorised customer representative. CAB / ECAB approval All Emergency changes are to be reviewed by the CAB / ECAB, where they will be approved or rejected. This is in addition to technical and customer approval.   Emergency A change in response to a major incident where the remedy requires immediate action and will be approved by the Major Incident Manager with evidence of retrospective approval from the customer being requested as soon as reasonably practicable.

9. Implementation and testing Change implementation All changes should be carried out as described in the RFC and within the designated planned times. If a variation is identified during the change, then this must be presented to either a member of the Change Management team or the Duty Manager to approve the variation. This variation must them be documented in the change notes. If the variation is not approved, this will result in the change being backed out. This change will then need to be re-planned and re-raised. Testing and validation Following the implementation of the change, tests in line with the testing plan set out in the change must be carried out to ensure that the desired result has been verified. If a change has not met the acceptance criteria, then the back-out plan must be invoked, as detailed in the RFC. Change completion Once the change has been tested and validated, the change status is changed to completed. Post implementation review (PIR) A change review should be carried to confirm that the change has met its objectives, that the change initiator and stakeholders are happy with the objectives, and that there have been no unexpected side effects (e.g. no P1 incidents after implementation) Spot checking of changes rather than large scale PIR’s is acceptable for successful changes, however a PIR is mandated for changes that have been rolled back, led to unexpected service impact or changes where there was a variation during implementation. Change closure Once the change owner has satisfied themselves all stages of the change life cycle has been completed, the change can be closed. 10. Customer Notification Notification Notice Period For planned changes which may cause outage or serious performance degradation for multiple customers, notifications must be issued at least 14 days in advance. In emergency situations, the 14 day notice period may be waived.
