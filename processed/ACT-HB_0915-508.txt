i FOREWORD  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the System Assessment and 
Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER)  Program to assist emergency responders 
making procurement decisions.  Located within the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS, the SAVER Program conducts objective assessments and validations on commercially available equipment and systems, and develops knowledge products that provide relevant equipment information to the emergency responder community.  The SAVER Program mission includes:  
• Conducting impartial, practitioner -relevant, operationally oriented assessments and 
validations of emergency  response  equipment  
• Providing information, in the form of knowledge products, that enables decision -makers and responders to better select, procure, use, and maintain emergency 
response  equipment.  
SAVER Program knowledge products provide information on equipment that falls under the categories listed in the DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL), focusing primarily on two main questions for the responder community: “What equipment is available?” and “How does it perform?”  These knowledge products are shared n ationally with the responder community, 
providing a life - and cost -saving asset to DHS, as well as to Federal, state, and local responders.  
The SAVER Program is supported by a network of Technical Agents who perform assessment and validation activities.  A s a SAVER Program Technical Agent, the Space and Naval Warfare 
Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic has been tasked to provide expertise and analysis on key subject areas, including communications, sensors, security, weapon detection, and surveillance, among others.  In support of this tasking , SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic developed 
this Access Control Technology Handbook  for use by the emergency responder community.  
Access Control Technologies fall  under  AEL reference number 14SW -01-PACS  titled System, 
Physical Access Control.

iv PREFACE  
This Access Control Technologies  Handbook  provides emergency responders, military and law 
enforcement  security managers , and other security professionals  with a reference on personnel 
and vehicle access control technologies, capabilities, and limitations.  This handbook provides 
introductory -level information on the technologies and components for physical access control, 
as well as an overview of operatin g principles and applications.  This handbook does not cover 
logical access control.  
Most of the access control systems currently used in the security field are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and have been successfully integrated into a wide rang e of other 
security systems .  Efforts to acquire or use access control technology should be undertaken only 
in consultation with organizations or individuals experienced in th is technology . 
The data presented in this handbook has been restricted to those e lements of an access control 
system that relate to personnel and vehicle access.  Definitions of terminology commonly used and/or associated with access control technologies are provided in Appendix A . 
The U.S. g overnment did not conduct independent tests of any access control technology 
products or systems in developing this handbook and does not warrant, guarantee, or endorse any specific products .  This handbook should not be considered definitive for use in planning or 
implementing a n access control system.  Such efforts should be undertaken only in consultation 
with organizations experienced in the various phases of planning, installing , testing, operating, 
and maintaining access control systems.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
1 1. INTRODUCTION 
This Access Control Technologies  Handbook  is a reference to be used during the  planning and 
design of access control systems.  This technolog y handbook is intended for use by emergency 
response personnel, disaster control personnel , civil disaster administrators, and local, state, and 
federal security and law enforcement agencies . 
This handbook provides basic information to organizations whose primary functions may not 
encom pass designing, evaluating, or installing  access control systems, but need introductory 
level information related to the purpose, operation, and application of these types of systems .  
Any organization seeking to implement an access control system should do so only with the assistance of personnel or organizations that specialize in designing and installing  such systems.  
Establishing an access control system involves not only design, installation, integration , and 
testing,  but also the long -term issues of operation, training, and maintenance. 
 Organization  1.1
The handbook is organized into four  sections.   Section 1 is the introduction that  describes the 
document’s goals and objectives.   Section 2 is an overview of the factors t o be considered prior 
to selecting a suite  of access control equipment .  Section 3 provides an overview of the major 
equipment categories and reviews each of the personnel and vehicle access control technologies.  
This section describes the technologies, h ow they operate, how they are applied, their 
performance metrics, and their possible vulnerabilities.   Section 4 provides guidance on selecting  
qualified vendors to assist the user in designing and/or implementing an access control system.  
This handbook is  best used by referring to the category overviews in S ection 3 to determine 
which set of technologies might be most appropriate for the user’s needs, and then reviewing the material on the individual technologies in the appropriate categories.  
 Objectives o f Access Control  1.2
There are four objectives in access control that are part of an integrated physical protection 
program:  
• Permit authorized persons to enter and exit ; and deny entry to unauthorized persons.  
The systems covered in this handbook deal primari ly with this aspect of access 
control. 
• Prevent entry of contraband material, such as weapons, explosives, and tools, or the 
entry or exit of any other material restricted by security management.  (Note : this 
handbook does not cover such equipment or methods. ) 
• Notify security personnel of attempts to gain unauthorized access or to tamper with or 
bypass the access control equipment.  Some access control systems are capable of detecting these attacks, but surveillance and intrusion detection systems are also prudent  supplemental technologies to consider.  
• Maintain records of access control system activity, user permissions, and facility 
configuration changes.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
2 2. ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS 
 Categories of Equipment  2.1
The access control equipment discussed in this handbook is divided into four categories:  
• Physical access control  systems  are the equipment  used to selectively restrict access to 
a location .  Physical control equipment usually begins the access control process at a 
distance outside a facility’s per imeter mainly by controlling vehicular movement and 
pedestrian access near points of entry.  For higher security  applications, access control 
continues  at building entrances  and secure area entrances . 
• Token and cipher systems  are mechanical devices or electronic systems that facilitate 
authentication for the bearer to enter a protected space.  A token is a physical device 
(i.e., ID card or key fob) that is kept on the user’s person for use with the token system.  Cipher locks perform a similar  function using a personal identification 
number (PIN) , or code, that must be keyed in for access. 
• Biometric systems  use physi cal or behavioral data measurements to determine 
authorization for access . 
• Assistive technologies involve the use of alternative or specially de signed equipment 
or implementation of special systems that enable personnel with disabilities to use the  
access control system . 
 Operational Requirements  2.2
Access control systems should be tailored to the needs and requirements of the resource or area 
to be protected.  The starting point for defining needs and requirements is to perform a  threat and  
vulnerability assessment.  The type of facility, the nature of the environment, the organization’s previous experience with access control system s, and assumptions about potential threats will 
influence the approach used to develop a solution.  O ther factors that should be considered in the 
vulnerability assessment  are the nature of activity in and around the site ; the size of the 
authorized population, varying degrees of accessibility , the physica l configuration of the facility , 
the surrounding natural and human environment , fluctuations and variations in the weather , and 
training  and support.  An ex perienced access control system  professional is an ess ential member  
of any program planning or vulnerability assessment team. 
There are four main elements of an access control system:  
• A barrier (e.g., vehicle gate, turnstile, door)  
• Verification equipment  (e.g., card reader, biometric scanner)  
• A panel that con trols the barrier  
• The communications infra structure that connects these elements and connects the 
system to the reaction elements , such as a n alarm monitoring system.  
Many access control systems incorporate surveillance equipment  to allow security personne l to 
assess an entry alarm and to dispatch response personnel to evaluate the alarm, manage the 
access problem, or deal with any threat.  A common choice for an assessment system is a 
closed - circuit television (CCTV) camera system.  In some applications , access control systems 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
3 for personnel and vehicles are used in conjunction with a set of physical barriers and i ntrusion 
detection sensors.  In order to operate, monitor, and maintain an access control system 
effectively, trained personnel are required .  An  equally professional team is needed to assess and 
respond to system alarms .  Some questions that may be considered before acquiring an access 
control sy stem are shown in Table 2- 1. 
Table 2- 1.  Questions to Consider When Acquiring Access Control Devices  
1. Will the system provide physical access control?  
2. Will the system  integrate with an existing access control system? 
3. How many access points require coverage by the access control system? 
4. What are the threats to the facility (i.e., terrorists, angry ex -coworkers, theft)?  
5. What are the highest value assets that need to be protected?  
a. High value material property?  
b. Intellectual property?  
c. Classified intelligence?  
6. Where are the sites of greatest vulnerability? 
7. What areas require additional restricted access?  
8. Do the controlled areas contain an adequate information technology (IT)  infrastructure?  
9. Should the access control technology have multiple functions?  
10. Are cipher locks required?  
11. Is a centralized network system required to monitor and program electronic locks?  
12. To what state will the system default in an emergency? (i.e., fail safe [unlock ] or fail secure 
[lock]?) 
13. Does the organization have a written policy for evacuation , and will the access control 
system be used for mustering ? 
14. Is automatic or remote operation of locks required?  
15. Does the security budget cover regular maintenance, training, and upgrades to the system? 
16. Does the system’s installer or vendor provide adequate training to operate the system ? 
17. Does the system include software or  network access that will require certification and/or 
accreditation by IT professionals?  
18. What impacts do updates or patches to the access control software/firmware have on 
sustainment, testing, and /or certification?  
19. What preventative maintenance is required and how often should that be performed?  
20. Does the system include new or emerging technologies ? 
21. What is the system reliability? 
22. Is cost effective vendor maintenance available?  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
4  Performance  2.3
The performance measure that characterizes all the categories of access control equipment in this 
handbook is throughput —the measure of the number of authorized persons or vehicles that can 
process through an ingress or egress point within a period of time.  Throughput is one of the system capabilities that must be weighed against a facility’s security needs.  Some of the most 
sophisticated equipment can allow quite high throughput rates.  In general, the higher the security requirement and the greater the number of access control devi ces one must pass through, 
the lower the throughput rates.  The performance of biometric systems is generally based upon the number of data reading errors or false identifications.  Those errors are defined and discussed in the biometric section’s overview  in Section 3.3.3. 
 Architecture 2.4
The architecture of an access control system should be developed as an integral part of an overall 
security system.  In general, ac cess control infrastructure consists of the following elements:  
• Intrusion detection  
• Surveillance  
• Communications  
• Response systems.  
Access control may start at some distance from a facility’s perimeter using features of terrain, roadway geometry, barriers, direction indications, and other mechanisms to guide vehicular traffic .  Figure 2 -1 is a sample access control schematic.   Direct interaction with access control 
syste ms normally begins at entry points around a facility’s perimeter.  At this point and at 
locations inside, access control may be manual or automated in some fashion.  Manual controls 
still rely on the access control systems for verification prior to manual authorization, such that a guard could use a CCTV camera and intercom placed near the barrier to identify personnel.  
Automated equipment may have an entire database resident at the site of the equipment, or the 
access control device may communicate with a centrally located or remote database.  The manner in which authorized user data is handled at any location depends on the overall system and equipment choices and should be carefully considered with access control professionals 
during the design process. 
Access Control Technologies Handbook

Figure 2 -1.  Access Control Schematic  
 Databases  2.5
Data regarding personnel authorized to enter parts of facilities may be paper -based , electronic, or 
both.  Small facilities or those that have relatively low -security requirements may use personnel 
to manage the information by hand.  Many facilities continue to meet thei r access control needs 
with security guards and identification badges or a token driven turnstile system that does not 
query a database.  Most electronic token and biometric systems interact with automated 
databases.  The operational portions of these data bases often maintain just the information 
reference record  used to verify or identify the user.  Personal information used to generate the 
record  may reside in archives or may be discarded after the records  are generated.  
Some electronic token and biometri c access control systems can verify at the reader without 
querying the central database.  M icroprocessor smart cards may carry their own authentication 
algorithms and templates.  Other systems’ templates are small enough that the entire databa se 
can reside in the readers.  The central databases may be less vulnerable to penetrations in such 
systems.  
Centralized electronic databases are used primarily to manage the p ool of authorized personnel 
and their access privileges and to maintain a record of ingress/e gress events.   Some software 
systems allow access privileges to be linked to security threat posture levels, organizational requirements, or other criteria, so that a change in criterion will automatically update the access privileges of each authorized individual.  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
6  Environmental  2.6
Many access control zones may have unique environmental characteristics that must be 
considered when designing the system, selecting the equipment, and performing the installation.  
Failure to consider all the factors can result in unacceptable performance, low reliability, or a 
short useful life.  Exterior zones are likely to be affected by the prevailing climate, seasonal extremes, and fluctuations in weather conditions.  Man- made environmental factors, such as 
activity patterns,  electrical fields, radio transmissions, and movements of vehicles, trucks, trains, 
or aircraft also influence the design and performance of integrated security and access control systems.  Interior zone access control equipment will generally be located i n more controlled 
climates, but several environmental factors, such as electronic interference, must still be taken into account.  
 Alarm Monitoring Systems  2.7
In addition to the commercial off -the-shelf (COTS) access control technologies that are 
discussed in this handbook, there is a variety of alarm  monitoring systems available.  
State -of-the-art systems provide visual and audible indications of an alarm.  The alarm data is 
displayed on a computer monitor as text or as symbols on a map of the area.  In most a utomated 
electronic access control systems, several of these capabilities are combined to provide the 
security operations c enter personnel with access control and intrusion detection information.  
Although each access control system is unique in the number  and scope of options available, all 
automated systems perform the basic function of annunciating alarms and displaying the alarm locations in some format.  
The control function of most of these systems is configured on a computer running any of the 
most popular operating systems, such as  Linux
®, Mac OS X®, UNIX®, or Windows®.  Some 
operate with proprietary software, written by the manufacturer of the access control system.   
Most  of the new security systems  have link s to mobile devices  for accessing system information . 
 Alarm Assessment  2.8
Assessing an access control system alarm involves evaluating the alarm and analyzing audible 
and visual data to determine if an unauthorized access has been attempted or has occurred.  The 
operator performs an assessment using  CCTV , thermal imagery, and sometimes response force 
observation.  Typically , the alarmed area is automatically displayed on monitors in the 
operations center and systematically recorded for future detailed analysis.  The operator dispatches the response f orce if required.  S ome control systems can direct the CCTV  or thermal 
imaging cameras toward a zone to provide the security personnel with a real -time view of the 
situation, to track the progress of an unauthorized access, and to hand off to adjacent moni toring 
and surveillance components as an intruder moves to other zones. 
Incorporating mobile devices  and laptop computers into many security command and  control 
systems by using wireless technologies provides the responder with the same information as the 
central monitoring personnel.  These capabilities significantly enhance the safety of responding personnel and allow for more efficient and appropriate responses to actual or suspected unauthorized access attempts.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
7  Integration 2.9
Many c urrent technolog ies have made integrating multiple access control devices into a cohesive 
security system more feasible.  Integration of access control technologies with other systems or 
technologies may require the development of a software interface unless the system has been 
designed to operate with other technologies.  Many  companies offer equipment designed to work 
with a variety of access control, intrusion detection, and  security systems  and provide an 
interface c ontrol document (ICD) .  The equipment ICD identifie s require ments associated with 
the access control system and its interface with other technologies . 
All access control technologies have vulnerabilities and may  generate false acceptances or 
rejections.  Generally, access control systems should be supplemented with multiple access control technologies to protect against the weaknesses of any one technology, to enhance the system’s overall effectiveness, and to provide means for security personnel to assess alarms and attempts to gain unauthorized access.  Many acces s control systems have the capability to notify 
security personnel of attempts by unauthorized persons to gain entry; to tamper with, cut, or bypass the access control equipment; or to attack the connectivity between the access control equipment and the pr ocessing or command and control stations.  Different access control devices 
can be integrated to reduce the chances of false acceptances and to provide alternatives for false rejections or inabilities to use a certain type of system.  
 Communications  2.10
Communi cations between the command  and control unit and the access control devices may 
employ a variety of standard communications protocols.  The building automation and control 
networks (BACnet) protocol is often used for access control systems.  The protocol provides 
mechanisms for building automation devices to exchange information.  It is an International 
Standards Organization ( ISO) standard protocol , which includes  Recommended S tandard 
232 ( RS-232), RS-485, Ethernet, Attached Resource Computer Network ( ARCNET ), and 
point -to-point communication s.  Occasionally a manufacturer will use a proprietary 
communications protocol that may  limit the possibility for future upgrades and system 
expansions  to the original manufacture r. 
 Power Requirements  2.11
Regardless of the quality of design and installation, most access control systems are vulnerable 
to electric power losses.  Some systems may not be able to reset automatically and c ould require 
operator intervention to restore  operati on, while other systems may require time to return to full 
operational status.  Potential intruders may be aware of these vulnerabilities and may seek to cut or interrupt power if they cannot circumvent the system by other means.  It is critical that all elements of the system have backup power systems incorporated into the design and operation to 
ensure  uninterrupted operation, alarm reporting, situation assessment, and intrusion response.  
Backup power sources may include uninterruptible power supplies, generators, or automatic bus power transfer switches.  
Power, line conditioning, and battery or ot her backup power requirements  should be defined 
during the system design phase . 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
8  Costs  2.12
The overall costs of an access control system can be difficult to estimate  and should be based on 
life cycle considerations.  A vendor’s bid may represent only the hardware cost, and may not 
include the costs of engineering design, construction, installation, testing, training, or maintenance.  
Often the costs associated with inf rastructure changes or the assessment and alarm reporting 
systems are more than the costs of the access control components.  Costs can be minimized by defining threats carefully , performing a detailed site survey,  and selecting between several 
technologies  that provide sim ilar categories of protection.   Additionally , using suitable existing 
infrastructure, such as power cabling or conduit, can help mitigate some costs.  Upgrade costs can sometimes be mitigated by choosing equipment compatible with existing  systems o r with 
parts of existing  systems.  
3. ACCESS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES  
 Physical Access Control  3.1
Physical access control begins at the  perimeter of a high- risk facility and is designed to restrict 
access and protect the employees and building functions and s ervices from outside threats.  The 
key element in protecting buildings is the establishment of an appropriate stand -off distance 
depending on the vulnerability assessment and the building characteristics.  The first line of 
defense is the design of roadways, approaches, and parking areas  in proximity of the building .  
The topics covered in this section are barriers, bollards, turnstiles and portals, and guard 
facilities.  
3.1.1  Barriers  
Barrier devices control vehicular access to specified areas while providing various levels of 
security to the facility.  Barriers generally protect and control vehicular entry points by allowing 
only authorized vehicles.  Many styles of barriers are available, such as wedge or drop arm 
barriers as well as ornate gates and planters.  R etractable or removable barriers are available for 
situations where occasional access may be needed for au thorized or emergency vehicles. 
Barriers primarily prevent unauthorize d vehicles from entering a controlled area by blocking the 
route of travel .  They can also be used to guide or slow traffic near a controlled area, deter 
vehicles by their presence, absorb the impact of a vehicle, and /or damage a vehicle during 
intrusion a ttempts.  There are several types of barriers available for specific applications, such as 
ornamental barriers at the edge of sidewalks  and retractable barriers for emergency vehi cle 
access to pedestrian areas.  
A barrier’s form, size, and design features v ary with the level of protection necessary.  Most 
traditional barriers are made of steel, concrete, or a combination of both and can be set above or 
below ground.  Barriers can be active or passive.  Active barriers  are manually or automatically 
activated in response to acts of aggression.  Passive barriers do not depend on detection or 
response and are usually stationary structures.  Passive barriers are usually used for perimeter protection and at entry points that  are rarely used or have restricted  traffic.

9 3.1.1.1   Crash Gates  
Crash gates are steel gates that slide across a roadway either on a track or through a roadside 
guide .  They are used to stop unwanted vehicle traffic.  When the vehicle is authorized, the gate 
opens to let the vehicle through.  Crash gates are an effective defense mechanism and can  be 
architecturally appealing.  
3.1.1.2  Ground Retractable Automobile Barrier  
The ground retractable automobile barrier (GRAB
®) system, as shown in Figure 3- 1, is 
an active vehicle barrier , which utilizes steel 
cables and energy absorbing pistons to stop vehicles while injury to vehicle occupants  is 
minimized .  It is designed to be reset and back 
in operation after an impact.  Due to its 
energy absorbing capabilities, the system 
provides security while preserving much of 
the integrity of the barrier .  This is an 
important consideration as many barriers are destroy ed after a vehicle impact,  leaving t he 
site vulnerable  while the barrier is restored . 
3.1.1.3  Wedge  
Wedge  barriers , as seen in Figure 3- 2, are hydraulically 
operated steel devices that angle upward  from ground 
level to create an impregnable edge above the surface 
of the road.  A retracted wedge barrier forms part of the 
road surface.  Once deployed, a wedge barrier makes a 
45° angle  from the road surface facing the direction of 
vehicle movement and is coupled to a foundation pad to 
absorb the kinetic energy from an impact.  These 
devices are very effective against an attempted 
vehicular breach.  
3.1.1.4  Drop Arm 
Drop arm barriers , as seen in Figure 3- 3, are commonly 
used at parking lots and garages  to control entry and exit 
of authorized vehicles .  The arms of some products are 
capable of stopping unauthorized vehicles when in the 
down posi tion.  Some drop arm barriers incorporate a 
cable designed to lasso and destroy the front end of a vehicle attempting a breach .

10 3.1.1.5  Portable Wedge  
Portable wedge barriers can be set up in as little as 15 minutes to a few hours without the need 
for excavation.  The crash protection ratings of portable wedges are often lower than those of permanent barriers, but they are still very effective.  Portable wedge barriers often sustain significant damage in a vehicle impact and may need to be repaired or replaced after an incident.  
3.1.1.6  Applications  
Barriers are used as a physical obstacle to block or restrict access to an area.  Some applications of barriers are:  
• Interior  barriers are useful in warehouses, parking garages, and other interior 
environments where vehicles are present.  Barriers may be placed to protect critical infrastructure, such as power control units or air conditioning units.  They may also protect pedestrian access areas or slow the progress of veh icular traffic through an 
area.  
• Exterior  barriers are pri marily used for exterior applications at any facility to help 
regulate vehicular traffic and to stop deliberate intrusion attempts.  
• Portable  barriers are useful for temporary perimeter and access control situations.  
They  cover a range from lightweight plastic devices to concrete versions that must be 
moved using mechanical lifting equipment .  Lightweight plastic versions are often 
brightly colored, can be water filled,  and are used in the same manner as traffic cones 
to warn the public  of hazardous conditions or of temporary vehicle access  restrictions . 
3.1.1.7  Performance Metrics  
U.S. federal agencies have developed systematic test standards using real crash tests to quantify, 
verify, and certify barrier performance.  These test methods were i nitially published and 
maintained by the U.S. Department of State (D oS) in 2003 as SD -STD -02.01 Revision A, which 
has been replaced since 200 9 with ASTM F 2656- 07 Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash 
Testing of Perimeter Barriers.  To obtain certificatio n, manufacturers must have their products 
tested by independent crash test facilities to demonstrate that they meet ASTM  standards.  This 
test method provides a structured procedure to establish a penetration rating for perimeter barriers subjected to a ve hicle impact.  Knowing the penetration rating can help agencies select 
an appropriate barrier for site -specific conditions around a facility.  
3.1.1.8  Vulnerabilities  
Barriers are often used to establish a stand -off distance for vehicle access to an area.  This is a 
common adversary delay time tactic ; however, barriers should be complimented by  an electronic 
sensor system that relays detection information back to a monitoring system.  
3.1.2  Bollards  
Bollards limit vehicular access to specified areas while providing various  levels of security to 
facilities and pedestrians.  Bollards allow unimpeded pedestrian passage, unlike barriers .  
Bollards come in a number of styles and provide different levels of security with a variety of aesthetic characteristics.  Retractable or rem ovable bollards are available for situations requiring 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
11 only occasional access for authorized or emergency vehicles.   Bollards can be constructed of 
concrete, steel, cast iron, or plastic in a variety of forms and sizes.  Bollards have  become more 
prevalent  in facility designs because of their high level of public acceptance .  They  guide and 
deter vehicles by their presence, but do not impede pedestrian traffic.  D uring vehicular intrusion 
attempts , bollards absorb kinetic energy and inflict vehicle damage . 
3.1.2.1  Fixed B ollards  
Fixed bollards , as shown in  Figure 3- 4, offer a high degree 
of cost effective protection.  They are commonly placed in 
and around airports, federal buildings, and other public facilities where vehicle control is required, but foot  traffic 
must be unimpeded.  Fixed bollards  are generally made 
from tubular steel or cast iron.  Some are filled with concrete for added strength.  The subsurface engineering of fixed bollards depends on the required level of protection. 
3.1.2.2  Removable Bollards  
Removable bollards may be required to create an 
emergency access route through a controlled perimeter or to increase security on an occasional basis.  Removable bollards lock into place and often have a cap to cover the foundation when the bollard is removed.  These devices are generally less protective than fixed bollards, because the foundation is less robust. 
3.1.2.3  Retractable or Automatic Bollards  
Retractable bollards, as shown in Figure 3- 5, are generally 
operated by hydraulic or pneumatic  power units and can be 
lowered into the ground to allow authorized or emergency vehicles to pass.  These bollards can return to full height i n 
the event of a security threat.  A manual method of operating them during a power or system failure is a standard feature.  The subsurface engineering depends on the required level of protection. 
3.1.2.4  Manual and Semi -Automatic Removable 
Bollards  
Manual and se mi-automatic bollards cost less than fully 
automatic bollards  and offer similar access control 
effectiveness.  These devices may be suitable when the 
quick response of automatic bollards is not necessary.  Semi -automatic bollards must be unlocked to change  the 
position from raised to retracted or vice versa.   
Figure 3 -4.  Fixed Bollards  
 
Figure 3 -5.  Retractable  
Bollards  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
12 Compressed gas is often used to raise a semi -automatic bollard;  although a hand crank or pull 
system may also be used.  Manual and semi -automatic bollards are essentially designed and 
installed in the s ame manner as automatic bollards, differing only in the manner in which they 
are deployed . 
3.1.2.5  Portable  Bollards  
Portable bollards range from lightweight plastic devices to concrete versions that must be moved 
using lifting equipment .  Portable bollards genera lly do not attach to a foundation.  Lightweight 
plastic versions are often covered with reflective tape and are used in the same manner as traffic cones to warn the public of hazardous conditions or of a temporary denial of vehicle access.  They may be use d to restrict vehicular traffic temporarily for a parade or other social event.  
Portable concrete bollards require mechanical assistance for transportation and placement.  These are often used to augment vehicular access control during periods of increased  security threat 
levels.  
3.1.2.6  Applications  
Bollards are primarily used for exterior applications, but are useful in interior applications where vehicles may be present, such as warehouses, parking garages, arenas, or stadiums.  In building interiors, bollards m ay be placed to protect critical infrastructure such as power control units, air 
conditioning units, pedestrian access areas, or locations where a separation between vehicle and  
pedestrian traffic is needed.  
In exterior applications, bollards can be used t o define a vehicle free area or to restrict vehicle 
traffic from certain routes and roadways.  Typical uses of portable bollards are to protect parking spaces, prevent vehicles from blocking a driveway, or provide  a warning of a safety hazard.  
3.1.2.7  Performance Metrics  
ASTM International Designation F 2656- 07 defines  systematic test standards using real crash 
tests to quantify, verify, and certify barrier performance .  Prior to receiving certification, 
manufacturers must have their products tested by an approved independent crash test 
organization to demonstrate that they meet ASTM standards.  
3.1.2.8  Vulnerabilities  
When it comes to bollards, visibility is the most important safety issue.  Retractable bollards may be triggered without a  pedestrian noticing.  Many vendors offer custom colors  which make the 
bollards more visible.  Most bollards have  highly reflective labels which  help further improve 
visibility.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
13 3.1.3  Turnstiles and Portals  
Turnstiles and portals manage pedestrian traffic 
flow and access at checkpoints.  Turnstile technologies range from a simple , stand- alone  
rotating tripod with no accounting functions to electrically activated barriers with optical scanner s that are components of fully automated 
access control systems . 
Portals are electrically controlled gates or doors used as controlled openings in a physical barrier.  Portals can be used singly or in sets to form mantraps  as a delay device.  Mantraps, as 
shown in Figure 3- 6, are an arrangement of 
doors, usually forming a small corridor or booth, which allows a person to enter and be identified before proceeding into a controlled area.  They are often used in high- security 
application s that require individual scrutiny and 
can tolerate low throughput rates.  
Turnstiles and portals encourage employees and visitors to abide by access control procedures and reduce the need for security personnel to monitor ingress and egress points.  Some products provide information on the direction of travel and can count the number of pedestrians .  Often 
the access approaches are arranged using markings or railings so that  people awaiting access will 
form a line.  Most manufacturers include audio or visual prompting devices to indicate the 
direction of travel and alarms for att empts to enter without authorization . 
3.1.3.1  Operation  
Turnstiles operate in many different ways .  In each 
application, they limit access using various barriers  that 
revolve, rotate, retract, or lever , as shown in Figure 3- 7.  
Many include provisions for additional access control devices including smartcard, proximity, and biometric devices.  While  full-height turnstiles may be used in 
high-security settings, waist high turnstiles are the most 
common. 
In both turnstile and portal operations, a pedestrian 
approaches and walks through or, may swipe a card, wave an access card by a reader, or enter  an access PIN  
on a keypad before walking through.  The access control system compares the data entered with the enrollment database and, if entry is authorized, signals the portal to open or the turnstile to release and allow access.   
Figure 3 -6.  Mantrap  
  
Figure 3 -7.  Turnstile  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
14 Some portals have optical  scanners or weight -sensitive floors that register a pedestrian’s entry to 
the access entry lane and regulate tailgating,  which is  when  a second person follow s closely 
behind without detection by the access control system .  These access control systems usu ally 
have an anti -passback feature that prevents an individual from passing their card or badge back 
to an unauthorized person attempting  to gain access .  The system sho ws the individual as in or 
out.  Once in, the system will not allow the same card to en ter again, and once out, the system 
will not allow the same card to exit again . 
3.1.3.2  Applications  
Turnstiles are used for pedestrian control in airports, schools, stadiums, arenas, perimeter and 
interior security, retail crowd control, transit fare collection, and lobby or building access control where high throughput is necessary.  Portals are used in higher security situations in which more scrutiny of each individual is required.  Portals are often interlocked as a mantrap when prolonged scrutiny is required of each person seeking access.  
3.1.3.3  Performance Metrics  
There is no single performance standard for turnstiles and portals.  Most are equipped with safety features that allow mass egress in emergencies.  Several manufacturers have equipment complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.   The specific application of 
access control technology also influences the performance of equipment.  Turnstiles have relatively high throughput, even though people must pass through the opening in a one -by-one 
sequence rather than as a crowd.  Portals have lower throughput than turnstiles, because the  
device must open and shut for each person passing through.  
3.1.3.4  Vulnerabilities  
Turnstile s and portals may be vulnerable to tailgating.  This can be avoided by incorporating 
additional security features . 
3.1.4  Guard Facilities  
Guard booths provide shelter for a faci lity’s guard or access control personnel , as shown in 
Figure 3- 8.  A guard booth is often the first thing a visitor encounters upon entering a secure 
facility.  Many booths on the market today combine aesthetic appeal with a high degree of strength and durability.  A guard booth may be nothing more than a physical shelter against the elements, or may be a component of a secure fortress against physical attacks.  High -security 
booths are available that meet or exceed commercial and federal standards for ballistic and explosion protection.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
15  
Figure 3 -8.  Guard Facility at Entry Point  
3.1.4.1  Operation  
A guard booth provides shelter and protects a facility’s security forces from the weather and, 
based on security requirements, protects against some forms of attack.  For high- security 
facilities, such as nuclear power plants or government facilities, guard booths may be the fir st 
line of defense against unwanted visitors or attacks.  When combined with other physical access control devices , as seen in Figure 3- 8, a facility can maintain a high degree of protection against 
a forced entry.  High -security booths built to federal  explosion resistance standards are designed 
to provide protection for the booth occupants  during an explosion.  
3.1.4.2  Applications  
Most guard booths are located out side a facil ity at vehicle entry and personnel access points.  
Personnel greeting or visitor check- in points are prime interior locations for guard booths.  They 
are often prefabricated according to the customer’s security and aesthetic needs and shipped directly to a  facility.  Many options are available that range from sliding transaction  drawers  to 
full restroom facilities.  Portable booths with various levels of ballistic and explo sion protection 
are available.  
3.1.4.3  Performance Metrics  
Guard booths can be built to provi de specific levels of protection against particular types of 
threats, most often firearms and explosions.  Standards for ballistic or explosion protection have been developed  by several U.S. g overnment and commercial entities, such as the National 
Institute of Justice (NIJ) and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for ballistic protection and by the General Services Administration (GSA) for explosion protection.  Security managers requiring high-security guard booths should consider incorporating minimum standoff distances for 
explosives, vehicle barriers, and delay devices into the overall security infrastructure.  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
16 3.1.4.4  Vulnerabilities  
Guard booths can  be circumvented in order to gain access to a location and should be used with 
other means of security, such as  perimeter fences and CCTV . 
 Tokens and Cipher Systems  3.2
There are at least three functional blocks in any mechanical or electronic token -based access 
control system: the token itself, the token reader, and an access control panel.  The access control 
panel p rovides control signals to the security devices, such as electric or magnetic locks, based 
on input from the token reader.  
A token is a physical device (i.e., ID card or key fob) that facilitates authentication for the bearer to enter a protected space .  A token may be examined by security personnel or authenticated 
electronically by the token reader using a challenge/response cycle such as an electronic password or PIN, verifying a biometric  sample , or using another algorithmic procedure.  
A properly design ed and installed token- based access control system can be used to monitor 
physical access, logical access  (e.g., computer and network), employee time and attendance, as 
well as a number of other functions tailored to meet an organization’s security and adm inistrative 
requirements.  Token- based access control has b een widely used for many years.  
The token systems discussed in this handbook vary in complexity, from simple to complicated, and for low  to high security applications .  Identification cards and bad ges are physical systems 
that require visual verification at a n entry point to be effective.  
Cipher systems allow personnel through a door after entering a multi -digit code.  Key card 
systems only  allow  those who have a specifically coded key card  to pass  through a particular 
door. 
The access control security level of a facility can be increased in three ways.  One is to use more capable access control systems at each entry point.  Another is to require  more than one access 
control technology at an entry point.  A common security process , known as two- factor 
authentication, is to present a token and require an additional piece of information that is usually memorized .  For instance, to use an automated teller machine (ATM), one must present a 
bankcard to the  machine and then enter a PIN  using a keypad.  A third way to increase access 
control security levels is to design layered systems, where fewer people have access to more sensitive areas inside the facility.  
3.2.1  Identification Cards and Badges  
Cards and badges  are the most common form of identification used in the access control 
industry.  Identification cards and badges are  usually slightly larger than a credit card.  They  
often have a picture of the holder, the holder’s name, the organization’s name or logo, and other 
pertinent information.  Barcoding, holographic imaging, water marking, and time expiring chemistry are the primary technologies available to customize a particular identification badging system beyond the basic information and photo.  Many card o r badge systems can accommodate 
more than one of these customizing technologies.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
17 3.2.1.1  Barcoding 
Cards and badges with barcodes can accomplish keyless automatic identification and data 
collection for access control systems  and are typically used in low security applications .  
Barcodes use vertical lines of varying height and width  which represent an  identification  security 
code.   The barcode is analyzed  by the reader, verified  against an access control list , and the card 
holder  is allowed or denied access to the area.  Several industries, specifically automotive, 
electronics, and chemical , have defined standards for their uses and applications.  These 
standards ensure universal compliance within an industry and identification accuracy better than 99 percent.  
3.2.1.2  Holographic Imaging 
A hologram is an image printed on a card or on the card’s lamination that uses light diffraction techniques to produce an image that can be seen , but not copied.  The holographic image is used 
as an anti -forgery technology on badges; however , the equipment used to create these images can 
be expensive and may not be cost -effective.  
3.2.1.3  Time Expiring Chemistry  
Time expiring cards or badges use techniques to imbed reactive chemicals into the surface or the lamination.  The chemicals react in a known  time period and change color.  Time expiring 
chemistry is useful for persons who should have only temporary access to a facility or area.  A time expiring badge can be pri nted with information or images, including photos, and then the 
technology applied a nd activated.  Time limits range from one hour to one month.  When the 
time runs out, the color changes or bleeds through on all or some portion of the card  or badge.  
3.2.1.4  Watermarking  
A watermark is an image in the surface or laminat ion that can be seen , but not copied, and can be 
used as an anti -forgery technology .   
3.2.1.5  Applications  
Identification cards and badges are first tier security tools.  For many facilities, they are all that is required.  Where guards are present to monitor access, persons entering  frequently  must show a 
facility badge or identification card.  Visitors and other persons lacking badges are moved  aside 
to apply for authorization to enter.  B adge holders are often required to display their badge  
prominently throughout their time in the  controlled area.  
Cards or badges can be the basis for h igh-security access control systems that depend on using 
personnel and administrative techniques instead of electronic infrastructure.  For example, some facilities use two photo identification badges  for access control.  The first badge is given to the 
portal control person, who matches it against a file of interior access badges.  When a match is found, the guard exchanges the badges and allows the individual to access the facility.  The second badge  is to be visible at all times in the protected area.  The badges are again swapped 
when the individual leaves the protected area.  While this type of system does not rely heavily on technology, it does offer some advantages.  The interior access badges ne ver leave the protected 
area.  When an access privilege is changed or revoked, the interior card is simply updated to reflect the new level of access.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
18 3.2.1.6  Performance Metrics  
Cards and badges are most often made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stock or rigid paper stock.  
PVC is durable, robust, and able to withstand a moderate amount of abuse.  Heavy or rigid paper stock is usually laminated after printing.  The process of issuing, showing, or wearing a badge provide s a basic level of access control  for many organizations .  It identifies the persons 
authorized access to a controlled facility or services , and provide s a quick, reliable means of 
visual identification.  
3.2.1.7  Vulnerabilities  
Cards and badges can fray, delaminate, or break while being carried, handled, or passed through readers.  Since potential intruders may try to copy or substitute cards or badges, some facilities use holograms or watermarks to complicate the counterfeiting  process.  Cards and badges are 
also susceptible to loss and theft.  Two -factor authorization, such as the card along with a 
password, a PIN, or biometric data, can help prevent an unauthorized person from gaining access with a lost or stolen card or badge . 
3.2.2  Keycard Door Systems 
Keycard door systems have a reader attached directly to a door and are an integral component of the latch control mechanism  (Figure 3- 9).  They  are often 
used in the hospitality and hospital 
industries to provide a relatively low level of security to client personnel in situations 
where each client needs authorization to open a few doors, perhaps his or her own room, and the building after hours.  Door mounted key card systems do not interact in real time with a central database.  Information on a door’s activity is stored  in a battery powered 
recording system inside the door -mounted box and must be downloaded into a hand held reader, 
which may th en be downloaded into a central record keeping computer . 
3.2.2.1  Operation  
A user must insert a valid card  (Figure 3- 10) into the reader 
on the door to release the lock and allow entry.  Each lock’s reader and latch control mechanism is self -contained and is 
not connected to a remote access control panel or a central control syste m. 
These systems are available in two  technologies:  magnetic  
encoded stripe and contact smart card.   Systems using 
magnetic  encoded  stripes and contact smart cards require a 
key to be encoded at the point where the card is issued.  The  
stripe normally  contain s about 140 digits and characters in 
one to three tracks , the user name, authorized access levels, 
expiration date, and other infor mation .  
Figure 3 -9.  Keycard Operation  
 
Figure 3 -10.  Types of 
Keycards  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
19 The quantity of information on contact smart cards can be much greater than on a magnetic 
encoded stripe card.  The magnetic encoded stripe and contact smart card key card systems 
should not be confused with the systems capable of very high security access control covered in the technology reviews on magnetic encoded stripe systems and contact smart card systems.  
Inserting a keycard into a lockset operates keycard locks.  Some systems read the presence of a 
valid card in the slot, and will remain unlocked as long as the card is present.  In other systems, such as magnetic encoded stripe, the card m ust be fully inserted and then removed to cycle the 
lock.  Many systems have red and green LED s on the lock face to indicate the state of the lock.  
When a valid card is detected, the green LED illuminates , the electric lock opens, and the user 
can operate the mechanical latch.  Operating the mechanical latch completes the cycle and resets the lock to the closed position.  When an invalid card is detected, the  red LED illuminates , the 
electric lock will not open, and the mechanical latch remains locked . 
3.2.2.2  Applications  
Keycard systems are not often used in high -security situations because the readers typically do 
not interact with a central access control database; however, this technology allows flexibility 
and fine -grained access control.  Fine -grained access control is the ability to permit or deny 
access through a single door or set of doors.  For example, doors can easily be re -keyed 
whenever a key is lost or stolen, and access can easily be modified for special requirements.  Room keys, staff keys, and manager keys can be coded to enhance both security and 
productivity.  R oom keys might operate a lock to the room and some common area, while a staff 
key could operate the locks for a series of rooms , but only  within a certain time period.  
Centralized control offers advantages in emergencies.  Access for fire and emergency crews can be coordinated and granted to affected areas quickly.  In systems where locks are under local 
control, having emergency policies set in advance can be beneficial.  Master keys should be 
protected from misuse , but still be readily accessible when necessary to protect the lives and 
possessions of occupants.  Fine -grained access control systems can also be used in schools, 
colleges, hospitals, public and private office buildings, and residences.  Keycard technology is suitable for both interior and exterior applications . 
3.2.2.3  Performance Metrics  
The performance of keycard -based door locking systems is measured by the number of cycles 
before corrective maintenance is required.  Vendors and manufacturers often advertise 
performance values near one million cycles.  
3.2.2.4  Vulne rabilities  
Properly engineered and maintained keycard systems are highly effective, especially when augmented with automated alarms and security monitoring and response forces.  The magnetic encoded stripe on some keycards is vulnerable to strong magnetic fields, which can corrupt the encoded information.  There have been additional concerns about the privacy of information on magn etic encoded stri pe and contact smart card -type keycards;  however, most systems only 
encode the access code and possibly the individual’s name on the card.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
20 3.2.3  Cipher Lock  
Gaining access using a cipher lock ( Figure 3 -11) requires 
memorization of a code or series of numbers.  Door lock 
systems of this type may be mechanical , electronic , or 
electro -mechanical .  Mechanical cipher locks normally 
attach to the door itself, while electronic cipher locks may be mounted on the door or on a wall next to the door they control.  Electronic cipher locks control an electric strike, striker plate, or l atch, and are operated by pressing a 
combination of buttons or rocker switches.  The buttons are often located behind a shield to prevent the combination from being observed.  The buttons on a mechanical cipher lock are arrayed in a circle or a vertical li ne near the knob 
that moves the bolt once the lock has been released.  This knob is known as a thumb turn or deadbolt lever.  Electro -
mechanical cipher locks share the features of electronic and mechanical locks and may have a dial type combination lock. 
3.2.3.1  Operation  
A user must press a valid combination of buttons or switches to release the lock and allow entry.  
A cipher lock is usually a self -contained unit, and operates without connection to a central 
control system or intermediate panel.  Security personnel can change the combinations on mechanical and electronic locks.  Some require special tools to change a combination, but such tools normally accompany the lock in a retail package.  
Electronic cipher locks may have some features and capabilities that are not available on mechanical locks.  Door mounted versions are usually powered by batteries and are self-contained.  Some electronic locks allow multiple combinations and keep a record of events 
in an electronic memory consisting of the date and time that the lock was operated and the combination used.  The multiple combination capability is an advantage because it allows each user to possess a unique access code.  Newer electronic cipher locks provide  additional functions 
through software and programming , such as  the ability to download an event record into a 
mobile device . 
Security managers can program electronic cipher  locks to stay open during certain periods and 
not respond to entry requests during other periods  such as holidays or after working hours.  Wall 
mounted cipher systems use standard electrical power  and offer many of the same capabilities as 
the self -contained door mounted versions.  Some cipher locks feature the ability to randomize the 
label assignments to the keys  in wall mounted units .  Each time the lock is operated, the keys are 
labeled differently to prevent an observer from learning a combination by watching hand movements.  Operating the door completes the lock cycle and resets the lock.  
Figure 3 -11.  Cipher Lock 
System 

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
21 3.2.3.2  Applications  
Cipher locks are predominantly found in access control applications requiring low to medium 
levels of security.   They  can be useful in high security situations when they are used in 
conjunction with access control systems that verify each user.  Record archives, organizational file facilities, mailrooms, and spaces containing potentially hazardous materials , such as 
pharmacies or paint storage rooms , are examples of appropriate applications for cipher lock 
systems.  These systems are also suitable for use in schools, colleges, public and pri vate office 
buildings, and residences.  Cipher lock systems can be used in both interior and exterior applications . 
3.2.3.3  Performance Metrics  
The performance of cipher lock systems is measured by the duration of time that the lock continues to perform under vari ous adverse conditions, such as exposure to extreme heat , dust, or 
high humidity . 
3.2.3.4  Vulnerabilities  
Properly maintained and administ ered cipher lock systems are highly effective, especially when 
augmented with automated alarms , CCTV  monitoring , and response forces.  However, t wo 
important vulnerabilities must be noted.  In cipher lock systems where many people use a single combination, the security manager can never be certain the combination has not been compromised.  The combination for this type lock shoul d be changed frequently to contain the 
effects of such a compromise.  Using systems that support multiple combinations can also decrease this vulnerability.  A second important vulnerability is locks requiring only three numbers in a combination can be def eated with persistence because there are only 1,000 possible 
combination results.  Tailgating is another possible vulnerability unless users are trained to notice who is entering with them and to be certain that the door shuts after use. 
3.2.4  Magnetic Stripe Cards  
Magnetic stripe cards are tokens used for authentication and access control in many security 
environments.  Magnetic stripe card readers can be interfaced with a variety of access control equipment, including locally controlled electrical locks, or c entrally controlled security 
databases.  Magnetic stripe cards are identical in composition and appearance to bank or credit cards.  The stripe normally contains  about 140 digits and characters, divided among one to thr ee 
tracks in a proprietary format.  T hey can double as identification cards or badges when they are 
printed or embossed with the user’s name, identification number, imprints of corporate or organizat ional logos, and a photograph.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
22 3.2.4.1  Operation  
Magnetic stripe card s must be either swiped through a reader track, as shown in Figure 3- 12, or 
fully inserted and then removed from a reader in order to cycle a lock.  Card readers can be 
mounted to adj acent walls, doorframes, or any convenient surface.  Many systems include red 
and green LEDs on the lock face to indicate the state of the lock.  When a valid card is detected, the green LED illuminates  and the electric lock opens.  When an invalid card is  detected, the red 
LED illuminates  and the electric lock will not open.  Depending on the system, the control of the 
lock can be located at the door , at an intermediate control panel, or at a central control station to 
manage authentication processes for a large facility with many authorized users.  Systems can be programmed so that an alarm is generated after a preset number of failed access attempts.  
Magnetic stripe readers detect the points on the stripe where the magnetic encoding reverses polarity.  Areas where two north magnetic poles or two south poles are adjacent cause a small 
voltage transient in the card reader.  These transients, used in combination with clocking and error checking algorithms, produce a series of binary  digits  that can be used to represent binary 
coded decimals, a limited set of A merican N ational S tandards Institute (ANSI)  alphanumeric 
characters, or information in another proprietary or encr ypted format.  Caution should be used 
when selecting a magnetic stripe card reader, because many readers only read track one or track two, but not both.  Encoding a magnetic stripe card is normally accomplished when a card is issued, using a card printer w ith the appropriate capabilities.  Card printers are widely available.  
3.2.4.2  Applications  
Magnetic stripe systems are used throughout the public and private sectors, because of their relatively low cost and versatility.  They are much more versatile than keycard  systems.  
Essentially keycard systems provide local control of an access point, but lack the capability of centralized control.  Often, keycard systems also lack recordkeeping capability ; however, 
magnetic stripe systems  offer both fine -grained control of  access points and detailed, real -time 
record keeping capability.  
Magnetic stripe systems achieve this using centralized system control.  In centralized systems, the security manager maintains a computerized database of authorized permissions for each cardholder .  When a cardholder operates a reader, the reader sends a signal back to the controller, 
which identifies the card -bearer and access point.  If a card -bearer has permission for th e door, 
then the access point opens.  Another advantage of centralized control is that the list of   
Figure 3 -12.  Magnetic Stripe Card  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
23 permissions for each user can change according to the situation.  For example, the permissions of 
every user could be revoked if it became necessary to lock everyone out of a facility.  Permissions for a single user could be re voked or modified during planned periods of absence 
such as vacation, holidays, business travel, or at certain times of the day.  Automated, centralized access control also provides more accurate record  keeping.  
Centralized control offers advantages in eme rgencies.   Access for fire and emergency crews can 
be coordinated and granted to affected areas quickly.  Fine -grained access control systems can be 
used in schools, colleges, hospitals, public and private off ice buildings, and residences. 
3.2.4.3  Performance Metr ics 
Like other electrical lock systems, the performance of magnetic stripe systems can be measured by the number of cycles performed before corrective maintenance is required or a card must be re-issued.  Vendors and manufacturers often advertise high perf ormance values; however, site-
specific conditions (e.g., extreme heat, dust, high humidity) can cause the actu al performance to 
be much lower . 
3.2.4.4  Vulnerabilities  
Equipment used to copy and encode magnetic stripe cards is commercially available; therefore, magnetic stripe cards can be copied and forged with relative ease.  Additional features imprinted 
on the card such as identification photographs, corporate logos, and holograms all help to minimize the chance of an effective forgery.  The information encoded on the magnetic stripe should differ from the information on the face of the card to prevent forgers from  simply 
encoding the  information from the card face.  
There have been concerns about the privacy of information on magnetic stripe cards; however, 
many systems now encrypt personal information, leaving only the access code and possibly the individual’s name encoded on the card.  Relatively weak magnetic field s can corrupt the encoded 
information on some cards, particularly the cards used with low -energy encoding devices.  Cards 
that use high energy encoding have a magnetic medium with greater permanence and resistance to ambient magnetic fields.  
3.2.5  Contact Smart Card  
Access control systems using the contact smart card can be employed in high- security 
applications  which involve l arge numbers of people that require significant flexibility and 
layering, but need only moderate throughput rates.  The se systems  are repl acing many of the key 
card and magnetic stripe systems due to their ease of use, security,  and reliability.  Homeland 
Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD -12) set s a clear goal to improve physical access 
control systems through the use of government -wide standards.  The Federal Information 
Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) defines characteristics of an  identity credential that can be 
interoperable government -wide.   Smart cards support the implementation of these standards.  
Smart cards usually look like  a common credit card, although other forms are commercially 
available in the form of jewelry, such as a ring, pendant, or bracelet.  The differences in appearance among the cards are aesthetic and are not related to the electronic features and functions a vailable on the integrated circuits  (IC) embedded in the plastic body of the cards.   
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
24 The type of embedded IC determines the capabilities of a card.  The two types of integrated 
circuits used in smart cards are microprocessor circuits and memory circuits.   The capabilities of 
a microprocessor card are roughly equivalent to a n early  generation personal computer  in terms 
of memory and processing speed; however, these capabilities are increas ing with newer card s.  
Memory cards usually store minimal amounts  of data, but such cards cannot perform data 
manipulations or computation, or execute processes, such as a collision resolution algorithm.  The card reader must apply any encryption or changes to the data on a memory card.  There are several memory configurat ions available, which allow certain sections of the onboard memory to 
be write -protected or reserved.  
3.2.5.1  Operation  
To operate a contact smart card system, a user must insert a card into a reader.  The card reader provides power to the card, which causes the card to initialize.  Depending on the type of card system, after initialization, the card can provide stored digital files such as biometric templates or encryption keys or perform algorithmic functions that have been defined by the security application programmers.  Regardless of the system architecture, the card reader authenticates  
the card and then sends a messag e to the access control panel to open the entry point.  A 
multitude of card readers are commercially available.  Contact smart card readers often have built in numeric keypads for entering PINs and provisions for connecting biometric devices for 
two-factor  authentication.  
The mode of operation of the contact smart card provides  some  advantages t o its use versus other 
access control technologies.   First, because contact smart cards must be inserted into and 
withdrawn from a reader,  as shown in Figure 3 -13, the system throughput tends to be lower than 
for other smart card  systems.  Fumbling with the card and a delay during the initialization when 
the card comes into contact with the reader contribute to the lower throughput.  Such a delay can 
be an advantage, because it provides the time required for touch -based and scan -based biometric 
authentication systems to work.  
  
Figure 3 -13.  Contact Smart Card  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
25 3.2.5.2  Applications  
Contact smart cards are suited for indoor , medium throughput access control systems where 
system flexibility is important.  They are often used in high- security facilities and can handle 
large numbers of users.  
Contact smart cards tend to be unsuitable for exterior applications because of the effects of  
weather on the contact points of the reader.  Contact smart cards can be used for both physical 
and logical access control, as well as for tracking employee time and attendance.  The overall value of the system can be increased by supporting other applications from the smart card platform.  Besides providing secure  identification and authentication, smart cards can be used as 
personal or organizational data holders a nd fiscal or accounting tools.  
As a digital data storage device, the contact smart card has many potential applications.   But 
when used specifically for  access control, microprocessor smart cards offer many important 
advantages.  The processor in the card enables the system manager to store the applications and computer programs on the card along with the data; magnetic stripe systems do not store enough information to have this capability.  The advantage is that the applications and programs can be specifically tailored for the user’s access control requirements and can be changed as the need arises.  For example, if a biometric system is used for authent ication, managing several thousand 
templates using the facility’s central database and network can become an enormous task.  Template management coupled with the multiple vulnerabilities associated with computer networking can disable  the facility’s securi ty program.  Alternatively, the biometric template can 
be stored on the user’s smart card so that the template is always available when the card is presented to a reader.  If the authentication algorithm is also stored on the card, then the card reader onl y needs to make the card run its own authentication program.  The card responds after 
verifying the biometric, which is stored and processed on the card.  The biometric template itself 
is more accessible and has a higher degree of security because the only  time it is present in the 
facility’s system is during enrollment.  
3.2.5.3  Performance Metrics  
Performance depends on the specific technologies and applications used.  The International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission  (ISO/IEC ) 7816 
provide s physical standards for contact smart cards, describing the size of the card, contact 
locations, electrical characteristics, and data transmission protocols.  Proprietary cards and systems exist, particularly with memory only card syste ms.  Transaction speed, as discussed in 
the contactless smart card technology review  in Section  0, is a useful performance metric.  The 
transaction speed of contact smart cards increases with higher processor  speeds.  Data collisions 
cannot occur because two cards cannot occupy the reader  at the same time . 
3.2.5.4  Vulnerabilities  
Smart card systems that place authentication algorithms and templates on the cards and do not maintain online databases of this information are intrinsically more secure than systems that maintain online template database s.  The only time a person’s template may be in the central 
network might be during enrollment for systems using card -based templates.  Online template 
databases have some vulnerability to hacking.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
26 There are a number of published procedures that detail met hods to compromise the data on cards.  
Methods include dismounting the chip and using microscopic electrical probes to record the 
actions of the microprocessor; selectively erasing parts of the card’s operating system to bypass or break encryption schemes;  and operating the card outside of temperature, supply voltage, or 
external clock speed parameters to cause a software fault and generate a memory data dump.  Normally, such assaults are cost prohibitive because the potential value of breaking the card is much less than the time invested.  Tamper detection and protection are important issues and should be discussed with the card system vendor.  
Punching holes in the card to attach a lanyard or a key chain can sever portions of the card’s electronics and ruin  it.  Strong magnetic fields can scramble or erase the memory on some cards.  
Card holders should be instructed on the proper care of the card to reduce the incidence of these problems. 
Overall, the vulnerability associated with the loss of a contact smartcard or a compromise of a 
PIN or password is less than that of many other systems.  If the card is regularly used for entry, then a lost card will be promptly reported and can be quickly invalidated.  Two- factor 
authentication makes personal information on a card more secure than information obtained from a stolen wallet or purse.  The information is even more secure if the car d has tamper resistant 
features  in the circuitry or encryption.  Finally, re -issuing a card is relatively simple, particularly 
if the issuing authority maintains an archive of card data.  
3.2.6  Contactless Smart Card  
Some access control systems use smart cards that, in addition to having processing or memory capabilities, have a radio frequency (RF) communications capability that allows a car d reader to 
interact with them at a short distance.  These are referred to as contactless smart cards.  
Contactless smart card systems can be used in high -security application s that may require greater 
throughput rates than contact smart card systems.  Som e smart cards can be equipped with 
magnetic stripes, barcodes, and other systems to facilitate access control . 
Contactless s mart cards resemble a common bank or credit c ard with an embedded microchip.  
Some vendors offer contactless smart devices in key fob or jewelry form.  In key fobs and forms 
other than cards, the electronic components are often embedded in an epoxy resin rather than the plastic matrix used for cards.  A contactless smart card must also have an antenna, which is embedded alongside the  microchip. 
A Combi C ard is another type of RF  capable smart card, which supports both the contact and 
contactless communication interfaces with a single microprocessor.   The personal identity 
verification (PIV) card is an example of a C ombi C ard.  FIPS 20 1 defines authentication 
mechanisms at three E -Authentication assurance levels ( i.e., some , high , and very high 
confidence ) and standardizes optional credential elements that extend trust in the PIV System to 
functions beyond authentication. 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
27 The ISO/IEC  has defined standards for the characteristics of two general categories of RF  
capable s mart cards.  
• Proximity Card, 13.56 MHz  ISO/IEC Standard 14443: Cards of this type are read -only 
and draw power from the card reader through inductive coupling.  The reader range is 
0 to 4 inches, depending on the specific brand of card and electronic elements supported.  The bit transfer rate for proximity cards is 106 kilobits per second ( kb/s).  
Cards of this standard represent the majority of contactless card deployments.  There are two sub -types of proximity cards:  
o ISO 14443 Type A:  The MIFARE
® card uses lower cost memory and is primarily 
used for contactless ID applications.  MIFARE is a proprietary series of chips that 
are used in proximity cards. 
o ISO 14443 Type B:  This  card offers a higher security microprocessor and 
encryption.  
• Vicinity Card, 13.56 MHz, ISO/IEC 15693: Cards of this type offer longer operational 
range.  These cards are often used for fare collection and inventory control tags.  There 
are three modes of operation: read, authenticate, and write.  The reader range varies by the mode used: read out to 25 inches, authenticate out to 20 inches, and write  out to 
15 inches.  The bit transfer rate is 26.69 kb/s. 
3.2.6.1  Operation  
As an individual approaches the entrance to a controlled area, the contactless smart card enters the detection field of the card reader.  Usually, the card bearer passes the card in front of the card reader at a distance of no more than 6 inches, but reade rs with ranges of  up to 6 feet are 
available.  
Some vendors recommend that the bearer tap the edge of the card on the face of the reader in order to keep the card in the reader field long enough to complete an authentication cycle.  The size of the detectio n field varies, depending on the transmission frequencies and system’s 
communications protocols.  In some systems, power is provided to the card from the detection field through the antenna.  When the card is not in the detection field it is inert.  Once powered, 
the card requires a very brief period for initialization.  T he card transmits the digital credentials 
to the card reader and if the individual is aut horized the entry is unlocked.  
3.2.6.2  Applications  
Hands -free operation of contactless smart card systems minimizes the time spent at a physical 
access portal.  This is an advantage for those workers carrying goods and materials into the workspace.  Hands -free operation is also a requirement often associated with systems that 
operate at high levels of throughput, such as large public buildings or sports venues, where large numbers of people pass through access portals within a brief period of time.  If high levels of throughput are required, caution should be used when selecting an appropriate technology for two-factor authentication.  Some contactless card readers often have built in numeric keypads for 
entering PINs , as shown in Figure 3- 14, and provisions for connecting biometric devices for 
two-factor authentication.  Contactless smart cards are best suited to applications where tracking 
personnel and materials inside a protected area are required.  This technology can be used for both inter ior and exterior applications. 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
28 3.2.6.3  Performance Metrics  
Performance depends on the system’s specific technologies and applications.  The general 
measures of contactless smart card performance include the transaction speed, read range, and the anti -collision techniques used.  
The transaction speed is the total time required to complete the assigned function.  A transaction cycle has four steps : input/output  (I/O), memory ac cess, encryption, and processing.  Benchmark 
transaction speed metrics can be misleading, particularly if one part of the cycle is heavily stressed over another.  For example, an access control application may only need to send a few bytes of information in order to authenticate.  In this case the I/O function may be under -stressed 
compared to the encryption or processing steps.  Another application could require transmitting several hundred bytes to provide a biometric template to a reader, stressing the I /O subsystems 
and leaving the processing step underutilized.  The transaction speed metric must be considered in the full context of the system’s use.  
Read range should also be considered within the context of the intended application.  The read range is t he maximum distance between the card and the reader where a transaction can be 
successful.  The primary factor affecting read range is the power requirement of the card.  Cards with microprocessors use more power than memory -only cards and require a shorte r read range.  
The strength of the reader field is another factor.  There will also be some variation in the power requirements between identical cards from  the same manufacturer.  
A collision occurs when a card reader sends out a request for data transfer and two or more cards 
respond at the same time.  Anti- collision techniques refer to the methods used to resolve 
collisions and return coherent messages to the reader from the cards in the field.  The speed at which the system can resolve collisions is a si gnificant factor in the system’s overall 
performance.  Collisions occur more frequently with longer read ranges  and longer transaction 
times.    
Figure 3 -14.  Contactless Smart Card  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
29 The t wo techniques  below,  which  are commonly used, require the card to have an on- board 
processo r. 
• Bit Collision Technique —when a collision is detected because the reader received 
unintelligible bits, the reader ignores the response and uses software techniques to 
restrict subsequent requests for data transfer until only one card responds.  Since the read range for t his type of card is only 4 inches, collisions will not be a major issue.  
ISO/IEC 14443 is the primary contactless smart card standard being used for transit, financial, and access control applications.  It is also used in electronic pa ssports and in 
the F IPS 201 PIV.  
• Slot Marker Technique —this technique requires the card reader , when idle, to send 
continuous request messages within a specific time slot to find cards in the vicinity .  
ISO/IEC 15693 establishes standards for the physical characteristics, rad io frequency 
power and signal interface, and anti -collision and transmission protocol for vicinity 
cards that operate to a maximum of 1 meter ( i.e., approximately 3.3 feet).  
3.2.6.4  Vulnerabilities  
Contactless s mart card systems that place authentication algorithm s and templates on the cards 
are intrinsically more secure than systems that maintain this information online.  Once online this information can be stored in central archives offline.  Online template databases always have some vulnerability to hacking.  O ther vulnerabilities are similar to the contact smart cards 
discussed in S ection 3.2.5.4. 
3.2.7  Wiegand Cards  
A Wiegand card is a plastic or vinyl credit -card sized devic e that contains  two rows of small 
parallel wires of proprietary composition that generate a binary number when the card is passed through a reader.  The wires are embedded within the card during the manufacturing process and provide protection against forgery.  Outside the reader’s magnetic field, the embedded wires are essentially inert.  
Wiegand access control systems were developed in the early 1970s and used throughout the public and private sectors.  However, m any Wiegand access control systems are agin g and 
require frequent maintenance.  The Wiegand card is largely being replaced by the smart card.  
3.2.8  Key Fobs  
Key fobs are used as interface devices to many access control and 
security  systems  (Figure 3-15).  Several of the technologies discussed in 
other sections of this handbook are available in key  fob configurations.  
They can be made of plastic, epoxy resin, or metal. 
3.2.8.1  Operation  
Depending on the system that it controls, key fobs can operate by a 
number of different methods.  Garage door openers, facility alarm controllers, and fobs used in the automotive and transportation industries transmit a c oded radio frequency  identification  (RFID) signal 
to a receiver inside the vehicle or facility when the operator presses an  
Figure 3 -15.  Key Fob  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
30 appropriate key or button.  Key fob s using RF transmissions are usually made of plastic or epoxy 
to avoid interference with the tran smitted signal.  The radio signal contains a binary number that 
is a control code.  Encrypting the transmitted signal can enhance the security of the system.  
3.2.8.2  Applications  
The key fob interface is flexible and is an element of many access control and securi ty systems.  
For example, a household garage door opener provides a basic access control system for many 
homeowners.  Such systems range in complexity from simply producing a loud alarm to systems with satellite communications, global positioning system (G PS) location, and remote 
disablement of a vehicle to prevent theft or other criminal activity.  Key fob s that control facility 
alarm systems often have a small keypad with three or four buttons.  Each button on the keypad controls a state of the alarm system , such as arm or disarm .  Key fob s used in facility alarm 
systems often include a duress alarm or a panic button that can trigger an alarm independently of the state of the system and sensors.  The key fob interface is suitable for both interior and exterior applications, and is particularly useful in vehicle and transportation industry applications. 
3.2.8.3  Performance Metrics  
The performance of key fob interfaces depends on the systems with which they interact.  Key 
fobs that use radio frequency transmissions will eventually require the battery or the whole fob to 
be replaced.  The range at which such systems operate is also a quantifiable consideration in the overall system design.  
3.2.8.4  Vulnerabilities  
Theft is the ma in vulnerability for key fobs.  Two -factor authentication, using a PIN or biometric  
access control , can significantly reduce the vulnerability of the entire access control system if a 
key fob is lost or stolen. 
 Biometric Access Control Technologies  3.3
Biometric access control refers to the use of human biological attributes for verification  or 
identification  in physical access control systems .  Biometric systems use phys ical or behavioral 
data measurements to compare with previously enrolled information to determine such system 
responses as establishing identity or granting access.  Biometric access control systems are built 
around some of the measurable attributes listed in Table 3- 1. 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
31 Table 3- 1.  Biometric Attributes Used in Access Control  Systems  
Biometric  Physi cal Behavioral  
Facial Recognition    
Fingerprint Recognition    
Hand/Finger Geometry  Recognition    
Vein Geometry  Recognition    
Iris Recognition    
Voice Recognition    
Signature Dynamics Recognition    
Most biometric access control systems feature the follow ing: 
• Physical characteristics include the anatomical components and physiological 
functioning of the human body, while behavioral characteristics describe the way an individual reacts or moves within the environment. 
• Biometric access control systems can be  automated so that they work without direct 
human intervention.  They generally produce an access control decision in a few seconds or less.  
• A human physical  and/or behavioral characteristic can be used as a biometric 
identifier if  it meets certain tests:  
o Universality: most people  should possess it  
o Unique : any two persons should always exhibit diffe rent versions of the same 
characteristic  
o Collectability: the characteristic must be easily and quickly measurable  
o Permanence: t he biometric measurement should be  stable over a long period of 
time. 
3.3.1  Devices 
Biometric access control devices extract measurements of the characteristic of interest, construct a mathematical template  from those measurements, and compare it to the reference record  in an 
enrollment database to control access.  This process is typically referred to as feature extraction.  Privacy concerns are minimized because the biometric parameter that was measured cannot be recreated from the template data.  For example, it is impossible to reconstruct th e fingerprint 
image from the template derived from a fingerprint scan.  
The reader uses  a predetermined number of points on the fingerprint and converts that 
information to binary data using mathematical computations.  This creates a sample template.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
32 The system compares this template to a database of fingerprint reference records  and either finds 
or fails to find a corresponding record  that identifies the subject.  Once the data is located or 
determined not to exist, the system processes this information accordingly .  Some systems may 
retain fingerprint images in an enrollment archive for retrieval.  
3.3.2  Verification  and Identification  
In access control security applications, biometric systems can be used for verification or 
identification.  Biometric systems enhance the access control verification and identification processes by capturing characteristics of individuals, extracting measurable features, and comparing the data against enrolled biometric records.  Unlike passwords or PINs, the en rolled 
biometric template cannot be shared or stolen; therefore, positive verification or identification can be assured within the limits of the biometric  system’s capability.  
Verification, sometimes referred to as one -to-one matching, determines if a pers on is whom he or 
she claims to be. This process involves capturing a person’s biometric data and matching it against an existing record for that person.  Verification requires a claimed identity typically using a token or a PIN.  Biometric systems automate  the verification process by capturing 
characteristics of individuals, extracting measurable features from them, and comparing the data against the enrolled record associated with the claimed identity.  If the match score meets the decision threshold, acce ss is allowed.  Otherwise, access is denied.  Verification is often used in 
access control systems where multifactor authentication is required.  
Identification, sometimes referred to as one -to-many matching, determines who an individual is. 
The identificat ion process would be used in situations when no credential or PIN is required to 
be presented to the access control system.  With this process, a record of a person may be known to exist in the database (i.e., closed -set identification) or may not be known  to exist in the 
database (i.e., open- set identification).  His or her biometric data is compared against all existing 
records in a database in order to find a match.  If a match is found and meets the decision 
threshold, access is allowed.  Otherwise, acc ess is denied.  Identification is typically used in low 
security applications.  
3.3.3  Performance Metrics  
There are four primary metrics associated with the performance of biometric systems.  These are the failure to enroll (FTE) rate, false match rate (FMR), fal se non- match rate (FNMR) , and the 
equal error rate (EER).  
The FTE is the probability that a user will be unable to enroll in a biometric system due to insufficiently distinctive biometric sample(s).  Users incapable of providing biometric data, such as amp utees, are normally not counted in a system’s FTE rate.  This rate varies with the type of 
biometric.  Some types of biometric access control systems are more susceptible to enrollment problems and each manufacturer deals with the problem in unique ways.  
The FMR is the probability that a system will confuse two different individuals.  That is, an 
access control system may allow an unauthorized individual to pass.  This rate must be extremely low for a system to be considered usable.  In most biometric secur ity systems, FMRs range 
between 0.00001 and 0.1 percent.  FMR is also known as false acceptance rate (FAR) in some access control systems.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
33 The FNMR is the probability that an individual’s data will not be matched to corresponding data 
in the access control  system database.  That is, the system will deny access to a person who 
should be authorized to enter a protected space.  This rate is also kept as low as possible to prevent users becoming frustrated with the system.  Biometric system FNMRs range between 0.000066 and 1.0 percent.  FNMR is called false reject ion rate (FRR) in some access control 
systems.  
One method of measuring overall performance of a biometric system is by looking at the EER.  The EER is defined as the point on a graph where the FMR and F NMR intersect.  That is, the 
same numbers of errors of both types (FMR and FNMR) are made.  The smaller the EER, the more accurate the biometric  system is.  
Depending on the application and the system selected, each of these metrics may be more or less impo rtant in the security scenario.  For example, just because biometric  system A has a lower 
score in FNMR than system B does not mean that for every application A is better than B.  
3.3.4  Threshold Adjustments  
The effectiveness  of the system is 
partially a function of its ease of use as well as its sensitivity.  Users prefer systems that are convenient, easy to work with, and reliable.  On the other hand, security considerations dictate that the system should never allow unauthorized persons to gain access.  At times, these are mutually exclusive 
concepts.  Biometric access control system sensitivity can be adjusted to favor security or convenience , as 
shown in  Figure 3- 16.  Since biometric 
systems are probabilistic , the allowable 
variation from exact conformance to the enrolled pattern is adjustable. 
3.3.5  Operation  
A user’s biometric data is collected in a process called enrollment to create a re ference template.  
Enrollment is the process by which the biometric data of individuals is captured and stored so 
that it can be used for matching at a later date.  A verification system, for example, could require the creation of a relatively small biometric database containing records on all personnel authorized to access a particular facility.   An identification system, however, must query  a much 
larger database, or set of databases, to identify the user against all others in the system.  
Depending on the  configuration of the system, the reference may either be stored within the 
system or stored electronically on a card or other type of token carried by the user.  When the user attempts access, the system captures a biometric sample and unique features of the sample are extracted and analyzed.  The results are then compared to the reference template in the enrollment database.  If a match is found within a certain level of tolerance, access is granted; if not, access is denied .

34 3.3.6  Facial Recognition  
Facial recognition is a biometric access control technology that uses one or more photographic 
images to recognize a person by measuring points on a face under controlled conditions.  Facial recognition systems are not intrusive, require no physical contact with the  user, and have a high 
rate of user acceptance.  
Facial recognition is not affected by race or gender -based differences in appearance.  It is a 
robust technology capable of handling a wide range of body types and facial characteristics.  Facial recognition is used throughout the world in industries as diverse as banking, gaming, healthcare, law enforcement, customs , and retail.  The technology has been tested successfully in 
neutral industry comparisons and is currently the fastest growing segment of the biometric access control market.  
Facial recognition has a number of desirable aspects.  
• The process is intuitive.  The user’s interaction with the camera is similar to being 
photographed for any number of identification applications, from driver’s licenses to 
passports. 
• Facial recognition is non -intrusive .  Unlike other biometric access control systems, 
facial recognition requires minimal interaction with the user.  
• Facial recognition is hands -free.  The user makes no ph ysical contact with the camera, 
or detecto r, and does not contaminate it with body oils or other debris . 
• Facial recognition systems retain a photographic record of attempted entries by unauthorized personnel.  Although some fingerprint systems can store the fingerprint of an unauthorized user, fingerprint analysis requires special training.  Analyzing and 
recognizing faces is a natur al, instinctive human behavior.  
• Finally, ambient lighting is sufficient for most facial recognition applications, with no 
requirement for special white or infrared lighting.  However, matching is most effective when the ambient lighting is similar to the lighting used to create the template during enrollment.  
3.3.6.1  Operation  
A number of  technologies are used in facial 
recognition access control systems.  The two major categories are video imaging and thermal imaging.  Video facial recognition analyzes the unique shape, pattern, and positioning of facial features by mapping those features  to create a mathematical model  
(Figure 3 -17).  Video can be further 
subdivided into two- dimensional (2- D) and 
three- dimensional (3 -D) imaging.  The 
number of cameras  used is the primary 
physical difference between the systems.   
Figure 3 -17.  3- D Facial Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
35 3-D systems use two cameras and integrate the images to create a 3 -D digital template.  In 2 -D 
models, a single camera acquires the image.  Thermal imaging uses an infrared camera to 
produce a f acial thermograph.  The system digitizes the thermal pattern resulting from the heat 
produced by the blood vessels under the skin.  
Facial recognition enrollment for access control purposes is straightforward, requiring 20 to  30 
seconds to take several pict ures of the enrollee’s face.  This photographic  sequence is best done 
with varying angles and expressions to allow for more accurate matching.  The system extracts the relevant information and uses mathematical techniques to create a reference template that is stored in the database.  
Verification is similar to  enrollment.  The user claims an identity through a login name, smart 
card, or terminal entry and then sits or stands in front of the camera for a few seconds.  The system captures an image, creates a template from the extracted information , compares it to the 
reference template, and then grants or denies access.  The point at which the two templates are similar enough to match, known as the threshold value, can be adjusted for different persons, time o f day, and other factors . 
3.3.6.2  Applications  
Facial recognition is useful for indoor verification applications where the ambient lighting and environment can be controlled.  The camera must be situated so that quality facial images can be captured.   Facial recog nition  is not recommended for areas where lighting is not uniform or 
situations where personnel protective equipment (PPE) , such as face masks, is required.  
3.3.6.3  Performance Metrics  
The most obvious and useful metric for facial recognition access control is the  quality of the 
capture device.  In general , the greater the resolution and contrast of the captured image, the 
better the system will recognize faces.  Processing time is an important factor in user acceptance.  A system should be able to discriminate a live face from attempts to spoof, or deceive, the system using a photograph or a video feed.  Finally, any access control system should have a low FMR . 
The reliability of some facial recognition systems can be affected by one or more factors involving the user or the environment.  Differences in the devices or the light conditions in the enrollment and field environments  can increase the false rejection rates.  Changes in facial hair, 
hairstyle, headgear, eyeglasses, body weight, or facial aspect ( e.g., angl e at which the image is 
captured) can change the facial shape or outline.  Loud or bright clothing can interfere with the system’s ability to distinguish the face in the image. Too much or too little movement on the part of the user can cause some systems to reject falsely or to fail to recognize a live face.  
3.3.6.4  Vulnerabilities  
Some 2 -D facial recognition systems may recognize photographs or video material as a face and 
allow access to an unauthorized person.  Systems that are 3 -D are not as vulnerable to spoofing .  
Recent 2 -D systems are capable of recognizing live faces and are not vulnerable to photo or 
video induced false matches. 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
36 3.3.7  Fingerprint Recognition 
Fingerprint recognition is one of the most widely used biometrics in the access control industry.  
This is because fingerprints are one of the oldest for ms of personal identification, inexpensive to 
collect and analyze, and they are stable.  Biometric fingerprint access control applications use 
one or both of two fingerprint characteristics:  ridge patterns and minutiae details , which are 
unique features found within the patterns.  Some extremely hi -tech biometric fingerprint 
scanners not only require a fingerprint to match, but they employ temperature and humidity monitors to ensure that a  live finger is being scanned.  
There are three basic patterns, as seen in Figure 3- 18, of fingerprint ridges:  the arch, loop, and 
whorl. 
• The arch is made up of ridges  lying one above the other in a general arching 
formation. 
• The loop is made up of ridges that enter from one side of the finger, form a curve, and 
then exit on the same side.  
• The whorl is made up of ridges that form a circular pattern around a central point.  
Minutiae recognition , as seen in  Figure 3- 19, is the most common form of biometric access  
control fingerprint identification.  Minutiae include the discontinuities that interrupt the 
otherwise smooth flow of fingerprint ridges and the a brupt ridge endings and bifurcations .  The 
major minutia features of fingerprints are bifurcation, dots, and ridge endings.  
• Bifurcations are the point s where one ridge divides into another . 
• Dots are very small ridges, no longer than the width of adjacent ridges . 
• Ridge ending  is the point where a ridge terminates.  
The ridge patterns and minutia e are important in fingerprint analysis since no two finger print s 
are identical.

3.3.7.1  Operation  
A fingerprint sensor is a device used to capture a digital image of a fingerprint .  There are several 
commercially available sensor technologies for electronically collecting fingerprints , including  
optical, silicon, ultrasound, and light emitting . 
Optical technology is the oldest and most widely used collection method.  For optical collection, 
the finger is placed on a proprietary, coated platen.  A charged coupled device (CCD) converts the image of the fingerprint, dark ridges and light valleys, into a di gital format .  Optical devices  
can withstand temperature fluctuations, are inexpensive, and provide resolution typically ranging from 500 to 1,000 dots per inch ( dpi).  Drawbacks of optical  technology primarily relate to the 
requirement to make contact with the reading device’s surface.  U sers leave residual fingerprints, 
grease, dirt, and other materials that interfere with  the reader’s performance and cause the 
reading surface to wear.  Some of t he new contact less optical fingerprinting detectors  eliminate 
these deficiencies.  
Silicon chip technology , or capacitance technology, has gained considerable acceptance since its 
introduction to the marketplace in the 1990s.  In most chip systems, t he sensor acts as one plate 
of a capacitor and the finger acts as the other.  The capacitance between the detector and the finger is converted into an  8-bit grayscale digital image.  Silicon generally produces better image 
quality with less surface area th an optical technology.  Silicon- based equipment can be much 
smaller than optical devices.  The primary drawbacks are a shorter track record for durability in 
suboptimal environments compared to optical technology, the smaller scanning surfaces, and issues relating to the requirement to touch the reader’s surface.  
Ultrasound technology has only recently been introduced to the biometric  market, thus it is not 
widely used.  Ultrasound uses high frequency sound waves to measure the impedance of the finger, air, and platen to generate a signal.  Sound waves penetrate the dirt, grease, and other contaminates  to obtain an image of the tissue and veins of the finger.  This process  can obtain 
usable prints in some situations that would impede optical systems.  Some systems can resolve fingerprints of small children, petite adults, and persons with dry, rough, or worn fingers that can be difficult for other syste ms.  Systems can also differentiate between dead skin and live skin.  
The technology’s  main drawback is its newness in the market and lack of a track record.  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
38 Light emitting sensor technology uses electroluminescence film on  its sensors.  W hen a finger is 
in contact with the film and an electric field is applied, a high resolution image of a fingerprint is 
produced.  The film is durable, works in direct sunlight, and is very lightweight , making  it easily 
adaptable for mobile applications.  
Regardless of the technology applied, 
there are several steps required to convert a high- quality captured print 
into a compact template.  Feature extraction, as this process is  called, is 
the basis by which fingerprint technology produces  a usable sample.  
The exact processes used are proprietary to each access control vendor.  As shown in Figure 3- 20, 
the user places a finger or fingers on 
the reader.  The reader captures the image and then, based on its design, will use complex algorithms to characterize the print for comparison to the template in the  access control 
database.  
Fingerprint scanning technology continues to advance in multiple ways, including image capture unaffected by lighting environment, spoofing detection of fake fingerprints, and liveness  
detection.  Liveness detection ensures a pulse is associated with the c aptured fingerprint sample 
to prevent the exploitative use of dismembered digits  or fake digits .  Also, highly detailed 3- D 
representations of finger surfaces and contactless live  scan  devices are being developed that 
produce prints of fingers, and in some  cases, the entire hand, from a standoff position. 
3.3.7.2  Applications  
Fingerprint -based access control systems are used for both identification and verification 
purposes.  The technology is mature and available from a variety of vendor sources.  Silicon chip  
and light emitting sensor based  systems can be small enough to use with mobile devices, such as 
smartphones , tablets , or laptop computers.  
Fingerprint -based access control systems are for indoor/outdoor use and respond well to a wide 
range of environmental humidity and temperature conditions. 
These systems are not recommended for applications in which users wear gloves or work  in 
conditions  that cause abrasion to the fingers and hands .  Such applications might include 
construction sites, nuclear/chemical surfa ce contamination areas, or foundries.  
Figure 3 -20.  Fingerprint Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
39 3.3.7.3  Performance Metrics  
The most fundamental feature of a reader is the size of the scanner’s sensing area.  The average 
size of a fingerprint is approximately 0.5 by  0.7 inches (smaller for children and females, larger 
for males).  A smaller reader surface obtains a partial print, which may not include all of the area 
required for enrollment scans.  Smaller reader surfaces render the system more sensitive to differences in finger positioning for each reading and may result  in unacceptable false rejection 
rates.  Optical and ultrasound systems are m ore likely to have larger sensing areas than chip 
systems, because large chips that perform uniformly over the entire surface are difficult and expensive to make.  The sensing are a of a chip system is dependent on the size of the chip. 
Rates of failure to enroll can be high for some systems when the user population includes 
children, petite adults, or persons with finger surfaces that are worn, rough, or dry. Recent technologies claim to have improved performance for these difficult categories. 
Another important parameter is the number of pixels characterizing an image ( i.e., resolution).  A  
minimum image resolution of 500 dpi is required by FBI -compliant systems .  To capture 
minu tiae requires a minimum of 250 to 300 dpi.  Resolutions higher than 500 dpi may be 
necessary to enroll children and petite adults whose print characteristics are too small and c lose 
for some systems to read.  
Finger placement is very important in order to obtain an accurate and repeatable print.  Other 
parameters of importance include the cleanliness of the finger, the contrast, and the amount of geometric distortion present in the sample.  Systems that require contact with the reading surface require relati vely frequent cleaning to remove latent prints and maintain high sensing accuracy.  
3.3.7.4  Vulnerabilities  
Some fingerprint systems may be vulnerable to spoofing using 3 -D molds of an enrollee’s 
fingerprint.  Technology to verify that a finger is live is available  in some systems to reduce the 
likelihood of spoofing . 
3.3.8  Hand/Finger Geometry  Recognition 
Hand geometry recognition systems are commonly available in two forms: f ull hand geometry 
systems that measure the entire hand, and finger geometry systems that measure only the index 
and middle fingers.  Hand and finger geometry biometrics are automated measurements of hand and finger dimensions taken from a three dimensional image.  A reader or camera captures up to 96 features of the hand such as the shape, width, length of fingers and knuckles, distance 
between joints, and the shape and thickness of the palm.  This is similar to some types of facial recognition systems in that it examines the spatial geometry of the hand and fingers.  Surface details such as fingerpri nts, lines, scars, dirt, and fingernails are ignored.  
Now a mature technology, hand geometry was one of the first methods of biometric access control in the modern marketplace.  Unlike other biometric access control systems, which have taken advantage of s uch technological breakthroughs as microchips or increased camera quality, 
the technology supporting hand geometry access control systems has not progressed significantly for many years.  Hand geometry access control systems have been in use for almost 30 years at 
facilities that include nuclear power plants, welfare centers, immigration f acilities, and day care 
centers . 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
40 3.3.8.1  Operation  
Capturing a hand or finger  geometry 
sample is straightforward , as shown in 
Figure 3- 21.  For hand geometry , the 
enrollee places their  hand , palm down, 
in a detector containing a flat plate 
with five pins that guide the 
placement of the fingers.  The detector registers the dimensions of the hand and fingers using an LED, a  camera, 
and mirrors.  Typically, three placements are required to enroll, and the enrollment template is a representation of  the average of the 
measurements from the three placements.  
3.3.8.2  Applications  
Hand geometry is a relatively accurate technology, but it draw s upon less data points  than  
fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition.  Hand geometry i s quite useful in verification, such as 
matching a known user to that user’s enrollment template .  The factor limiting hand and finger 
geometry to verification applications  is that hands and fingers do not vary enough in dimensions 
to generate unique templ ates in large populations of users.  Within the acceptance tolerances of 
the detector, each time a user seeks access, the data for more than one enrollee could generate a match.  Therefore, an identification process , such as using  a PIN, fingerprint, smart  card read er, 
or some other device , should accompany hand  geometry systems.  
Hand geometry access control systems are especially useful in outdoor environments because the detectors are resistant to many environmental factors, such as ambient lighting or te mperature 
changes.  Hand geometry templates are small, making them portable and enabling the entire control system to be contained in a single detector unit.  Since dirty or soiled hands do not affect hand geometry access control devices, these systems can  be used at con struction sites and 
foundries . 
3.3.8.3  Performance Metrics  
System operation is comparatively fast for access control.  Access authorization typically takes place in two to three seconds.  Throughput can be up to 10 users per minute. 
Hand geometry FT E rates are low compared to some other biometric systems .  FTE rates 
measure the likelihood that a user is incapable of enrolling in the system.  Fingerprint 
recognition, for example, is prone to elevated FTE  rates  because of poor quality fingerprints, and 
facial recognition requires consistent lighting to enroll a user.  Hand geometry does not suffer from such operational or environmental constraints.  Hand geometry can have higher FMR rates making it more suitable for verification than identification.  Si nce most users can use hand 
geometry for access control, few employees and visitors need to be processed outside the system.   
Figure 3 -21.  Hand  or Finger Geometry Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
41 3.3.8.4  Vulnerabilities  
The primary vulnerability of hand/finger geometry systems is the probability that more than one 
person’s hand/finge r geometry sample meets the threshold criteria for a match with a template is 
significantly greater than most other biometric systems.   This also makes hand geometry more 
vulnerable to spoofing attacks. 
Some situations involving a user can result in false rejections.  Swelling or injury to the hand, the 
presence of bandages or jewelry, and changes in weight that affect the dimensions of the hand can result in false readings.  Incorrect placement of the hand can also result in inaccurate measurement.  
3.3.9   Vascul ar Pattern  Recognition 
Vascular pattern recognition access control systems use the patterns formed by vein s on certain 
parts of the body, such as the back of a hand, finger, wrist, or face.   These systems can be used 
for identification and verification.  V ascular pattern recognition is a relatively new technology 
within the biometric access control industry and uses miniaturized infrared scanning technologies.  Although t hese systems are less mature and may be more costly than other access 
control technolog ies, the maturity of v ascular pattern  recognition is increasing.  
3.3.9.1  Operation  
An infrared camera used as a scanner can detect the pattern of  veins located directly 
under the skin.  These patterns are unique to an individual and do not vary over a person’s life. 
During enrollment, a user positions the required skin area over the scanner opening while the scanner makes several infrared pictures , as shown in Figure 3- 22.  The system 
produces grayscale images of the infrared pictures, which are converted to binary representations.  Algorithms extract the useful features from the bina ry pictures and render 
them as a mathematical pattern or reference record, for matching during later verific ations . 
To gain access, the user ’s vein sample is taken .  The system then computes a template and 
compares it to the reference templates generated during enrollment.  The system grants access if the template meets the criteria of a match.  
3.3.9.2  Applications  
Vascular pattern recognition systems can be used in high -security access control situations 
requiring identification or verification.  They can be prog rammed to read body areas other than 
hands when many employees’ hands  might be otherwise occupied.  V ascular  recognition 
technology is widely deployed at ATMs in Japan.  
Figure 3 -22.  V ascular Pattern  Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
42 3.3.9.3  Performance Metrics  
Manufacturers claim a 99.98 percent enrollment rate, one of the hig hest rates in the biometric 
device industry.  Users accept this type of biometric because it is non- intrusive, requires minimal 
contact with the skin, and takes less than one second to return a result even on large systems with 
several thousand registered users.  Since these systems are relatively new to the market, they lack the long -term performance track records of older, more mature technologies. 
3.3.9.4  Vulnerabilities  
Few vulnerabilities are associated with v ascular pattern recognition  systems.  The operating  
principle behind these systems relies on blood flow through the veins. It is nearly impossible to defeat a properly functioning system.  
3.3.10  Iris Recognition 
The iris recognition system takes an infrared picture of the iris from a distance of 4 inches to 6 feet .  This is considered by users to be non- intrusive .  The iris is the plainly visible, colored 
ring that surrounds the pupil.  It is a muscular structure that controls the amount of light entering the eye.  The iris is composed of measurable intricate deta ils called striations, pits, and furrows.  
No two irises are alike; even a person’s two irises are completely different.  The quantity of unique information that can be measured in a single iris is much greater than in  fingerprints.  
Iris recognition technology has traditionally been deployed in high- security situations when 
imaging ca n be done at a distance of less than three feet , and there is a need to search very large 
databases without incurring false matches.  These systems are in use in a number of hi gh profile 
applications, including airline passenger screening , prisoner recognition, and physical access to 
healthcare records.  Iris recognition systems are:  
• Stable —the human iris remain s stable over the course of a person’s entire lifetime.  
This makes iris recognition a very desirable biometric for access control uses.  
• Unique —iris recognition is widely regarded as the most accurate biometric 
methodology due to the rich level of detail that can be gathered.  Available systems capture over 240 unique characteristics in formulating the template , which is over 
10 times as much as other biometric systems .  The probability of two irises having the 
same pattern is essentially zero.  
• Flexible —unlike some other biometric access control systems, iris recognition 
requires no physical contact.  This means it is ideally suited for use in environments where gloves or other protective gear is used.  Iris recognition technology can integrate easily into existing a ccess control systems or operate as a stand -alone system.  
• Reliable —since the system uses infrared images, only a live iris can register.  The 
distinctive iris pattern is not susceptible to theft, loss, or duplication.  The illegal use of an iris pattern fr om an authorized user is unlikely and models of the iris that can 
fool the detector are almost impossible to produce.  At death, iris tissue is one of the first body tissues to deteriorate; forensic pathologists use the iris as an accurate estimator of the  time of death.  This prevents spoofing the system using an eye 
removed from an authorized user. 
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
43 • Non-Intrusive —although the term “iris scanning” is often used in reference to iris 
recognition technology, there is no scanning involved.  Iris recognition use s a camera 
to capture an image of the iris and then convert s that image into a template.  No bright 
lights or lasers are used in the imaging process.  Glasses and most contact lenses can 
be worn during the procedure without compromising the system’s accura cy. 
3.3.10.1  Operation  
In 1993, Dr. John Daugman, Ph.D., Cambridge University, England, first described the process for obtaining and processing iris images using near infrared (NIR) light to identify the patterns present in the iris not normally seen with visible light.  
Daugman’s process uses a dedicated monochrome CCD  camera no more than 3 feet from the eye 
using both visible and infrared light.  The fre quency range of infrared light (i.e., 700 nano meters 
[NM] to 900 nm ) is the same range used by ophthalmologists to study macular cysts and is 
harmless to the eye.  The LEDs used to produce this light are similar to those used in television remote controls, toys, and other consumer products.  The energy entering the eye is much less than when a person stands in sunli ght or looks at an incandescent lamp. 
Various factors can affect an image of the iris including the camera angle, size of the pupil, angle of the head, or direction of the eye position.  Vendors use mathematical methods to  compensate 
for these factors.  
The core of the iris recognition system ( Figure 3- 23) is the software that performs the following 
functions:  
• Acquires the imag e of the eye including the iris . 
• Defines the boundaries of the iris.  The software narrows the image in from the right  
and left periphery to locate the outer edge of the iris.  This horizontal approach accounts for the obstruction caused  by the eyelids.  At the same time, it locates the 
pupil (inner edge of the iris) and excludes the lower 90 degree  cone  of the iris due t o 
inherent moisture and lighting issues . 
• Establishes a polar coordinate system over the iris . 
• Defines zones for analysis within the coordinate system.  Some filters span as much as 70 percent of the iris, but most use less.  The images provide exceptional detail, well beyond what a pictorial or point -based representation could provide . 
• Analyzes image data by converting it into complex mathematical expressions in a 
process called demodulation.  The algorithms filter and map the segments of the eye 
into hundr eds of vectors similar to a DNA sequence code.  These vectors define “the 
what ” and “the where ” of the sub- image . 
• Generates a template.  At this point the database will not be comparing images of the 
iris, but rather hexadecimal representations of data ret urned by the demodulation 
process . 
• Stores and often encrypts the template . 
• Matches the user’s access request template to the enrollment template to grant or deny access.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
44 3.3.10.2  Applications  
Iris recognition access control is highly accurate and is a good choice for high -security 
applications.  Iris recognition can be used for identification and verification tasks.  Prisoner 
verification is one of the common uses of iris recogniti on in law enforcement .  Additionally, the 
FBI is adding iris recognition to its national biometric  database.  
3.3.10.3  Performance Metrics  
The minimum imaging system resolution to capture the rich details of the iris pattern requires at least 50 pixels in the iris r adius.  Most commercial systems capture from 100 to 140 pixels.  
Most software vendors advertise speeds of over 500,000 image matches per second.  Overall, system cycle times from the initial reading to access should be a few  seconds  for a standalone 
iris recognition device .  Manufacturers’ claims for accuracy may overstate the actual  capability  
of the technology.  Most EER measures are derived from assessment and matching ideal iris images.  
3.3.10.4  Vulnerabilities  
Iris recognition technology  require s a reasonably controlled and cooperative user .  Traditionally 
the enrollee must remain  still for a moment in a certain spot; however, emerging technology is 
able to capture the iris without requiring the person  to remain still.   Many users struggle to 
interact with the s ystem until they become accustomed to its operation ; however, like other 
biometric modalities, as a person becomes more familiar with the system false rejections decrease.  
Image matches depend on the quality of the image.  A poor quality enrollment can make later 
matches more difficult.   
Figure 3 -23.  Iris Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
45 3.3.11  Retina Scan  
The retina is a thin nerve (1/50 of an inch) on the back of the eye.  It is the part of the eye that 
senses light and sends impulses through the optic nerve to the brain.  It is the rough biological equivalent of  the film in a camera.  Blood vessels, the parts used for biometric identification, are 
found in the top layer of the retina and form a pattern that is unique to each individual. 
Retina scan is one of the oldest biometrics.  In the 1930s, research suggeste d that the blood vein 
patterns on the back of the eye were unique to the individual.  The first commercially available 
identification systems were developed in the mid -1980s.  Later developments made the scanner 
units smaller and less expensive ; however, because of implementation costs, difficulty in 
collecting samples, and negative perceptions regarding intrusiveness, their use has declined significantly.  H igh-security applications with low throughput requirements and relatively few 
authorized users  is one of the few remaining uses of retina scan technology.  
3.3.12  Voice Recognition  
Voice recognition technology uses the unique aspects of human voice patterns to verify the identity of individuals.  The fundamental theory for voice recognition is that every voice is distinct and unique enough to identify the speaker.  T he shape of the v ocal tract changes a s a 
person speaks .  The different shapes that the vocal tract assumes and the individual’s speaking 
behaviors contribute to the uniqueness of the voiceprint. 
Currently, voice recognition is being used in a number of market sectors including warehouse 
and distribution, electronic commerce, financial services, government, healthcare, and telecommunications.  Although not suitable for high- security solutions as a single method of 
access control, v oice recognition technology is useful  in low er security and in multimodal 
applications in combination with other biometrics and electronic access control technologies.  
Some systems measure the rhythm, tone, and pitch an individual uses to repeat one or more passphrases.  Newer systems use proprietar y algorithms to analyze the vocal tract to generate a 
secure voiceprint.  Another feature to increase the security of voiceprints is the use of random passphrases.  A  human can listen to  and repeat a phrase that recordings cannot duplicate.  Voice 
recognit ion technology continues to advance, and systems are becoming more sophisticated so 
that passphrases can consist of any phrase that the individual wishes to use in any language.  The phrase itself is not important as  long as it matches what the enrolled co mputer database expects.  
It is the unique characteristics of the voice itself that are patterned.  
Voice recognition has only recently emerged as a means for physical access control.  Voice recognition has been used in one form or another for almost 30 yea rs, but it is only in the past 
few years that advances in computer processing power and software development have made it commercially viable.  Prior uses were mainly for speech recognition purposes ( i.e., translation of 
spoken words  into text) or for logical access to computer sys tems.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
46 3.3.12.1  Operation  
Voice recognition can use any audio capture device.  Most software contains extensive filters to 
distinguish between background noise and a user’s spoken passphrase.   In high noise environments, the system must use a noise -canceling, close -talk microphone  that favors the 
user’s voice  and eliminates most of the extraneous surrounding noise.  The ambient noise levels 
at the points of access and enrollment should influence the choice of input device.  
Figure 3- 24 depicts the operation of a 
voice recognition system.  During enrollment, an individual repeats a passphrase or a sequence of numbers .  
Passphrases should be approximately 1 to 
1.5 seconds in length.  Very short passphrases lack enough identifying data, 
and long passphrases have too much data.  Both cases result in reduced accuracy.  The individual repeats the phrase a set number of times, and enrollment usually is completed in approximately 30 seconds , 
which is  slightly longer than most other 
biometric access control systems  require . 
3.3.12.2  Applications  
Applications of this technology include warehouse inventory control and shipping, banking, corrections facilities, general access control, securing access to confidential i nformation, call 
centers, and access to voice portals.  
3.3.12.3  Performance Metrics  
The performance of voice recognition systems can vary with the quality of the audio signal and differences between enrollment /recognition devices and ambient environments.  The same  types 
of devices should be used for enrollment and recognition. 
FMR and FNMR can be higher in this type of system compared to several other biometric 
technologies.  Although these rates are scalable depending on the system application, the units may have either a high tolerance (low security) or high FNMRs. 
The verification process in voice recognition can require from  2 seconds to 10 seconds, 
depending on the system.  This rate will affect throughput.  
The size of voice recognition templates can be a storage problem for large user populations. 
3.3.12.4  Vulnerabilities  
Concerns about the user having a n illness  that affects the quality of the spoken responses have 
been minimized through software development.  Voiceprints are generated based on the vocal  
Figure 3 -24.  Voice Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
47 tract and  learned speaking habits.  Common colds do not affect these traits ; however, if the user 
contracts  laryngitis , accuracy of the measurement  would be diminished. 
No individual can mimic the unique voice patterns of another person.  Mimics depend on 
mannerism , rhythm, and intonation to impersonate an individual, but voice recognition 
technology focuses on different characteristics than does the human ear.  Any attempt to breach a voice recognition system using an impersonation of an authentic enrolled user fai ls because the 
system relies on the unique tones produced by the vocal chords rather than the mannerisms and rhythms of speech.  
Tape- recorded attacks on the access control system are also easily defeated.  No recording device 
can perfectly reproduce the ch aracteristics of the vocal tract, so recorded voices typically fail to 
match the template.  Also, most new systems utilize real time random prompting for passphrases and the responses cannot be pre -recorded.  
Since vocal tracts change with age, most current  voice activated access control systems track 
gradual changes to a user’s voiceprint over time to compensate.  
Issues that can affect voice recognition template quality include:  
• Different enrollment and recognition capture devices  
• Different enrollment and r ecognition environments  
• Individuals speaking in a low voice or speaking softly  
• Poor placement of the microphone or other capture device  
• Phone line quality , where the passphrase is  repeated into a telephone . 
3.3.13  Signature Dynamics  Recognition 
Dynamic signature recognition is a biometric technology that is used to identify a user from a handwritten signature.  This is done by analyzing the shape, speed, stroke, pen pressure, and timing information during the act of signing.  S ignature dynamics is not frequently used for 
physical access control.  
Many people are aware of the concept of signature analysis, which consists of determining if a signature was probably written by the same person who wrote a reference signature.  Signature dynamics, on the other hand, takes  into account how the signature was made.  The changes in 
speed, pressure, timing ( i.e., natural rhythms), and sequential stroke patterns that occur when an 
individual signs his/her name are learned behaviors unique to that individual.  While it is possibl e for a computer, a copy machine, or an expert forger to duplicate the look of a signature, 
the other components are unique to the original signer.  Although slight variations in a person’s handwritten signature are common, the consistency that natural mot ion and practice create over 
time is a measurable, unique pattern.  
Signature verification has a high user acceptance rate, because the signature is so often used for identification in other contexts.  Legal documents, credit charges, and many other daily transactions use signatures for  identification and processing.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
48 3.3.13.1  Operation  
Signature dynamics technology uses the 
distinctive aspects of the signature to verify the identity of the individual.  The technology examines the behavioral components of the signature such as stroke order, speed, acceleration, and pen pressure to construct a multi- dimensional digital 
image of the signature (Figure  3-25). 
A signature is recorded on the screen of a digital tablet with a stylus.  The surface of the tablet screen is pressure sensitive to record parameters.  The stylus on some tablets has a pr essure sensitive tip that 
records writing pressure in addition to the measurements from the screen.  At least one manufacturer has developed a special motion sensitive pen that records the signature as it moves across a special writing surface.  
During enrollment, the system develops a template based on the most common and notable characteristics of the user’s signature style .  The user provides several signatures that are similar 
enough that the system can locate a large percentage of the common characteris tics among the 
signatures.  Some systems generate a single reference template, while others record all the enrollment signatures to be reference templates.  These reference templates are either saved in a 
central database or recorded on a smart card that t he user carries.  The location of the reference 
template depends on the system and the facility’s overall security configuration. 
The user must be relatively consistent during subsequent signature events for the system to verify 
identity.  Most signature -based systems modify the reference template with each event to 
accommodate changes in personal style over time.  
3.3.13.2  Applications  
Signature dynamics access control systems can be used for either identification or verification.  These systems are often implemented in controlled access situations where signature or written input processes are already in place.  Examples include applications where written access logs are maintained, in financial institutions, or at prescription counters in pharmacies.  
3.3.13.3  Performance Metrics  
Enrollment times typically take up to 30 seconds from start to finish, because each user provides several signatures for the system to analyze.  
Verification times vary from 4 to 6 seconds.  Throughput rates are generally less than 10 users per minute in practice.  The FMR is typically low, on the order of 0.001 percent.  On the other hand, FNMR can be typically around 10 to 20 percent or higher if the user does not have a consistent signature  which can be a major issue in most applications .  Figure  3-25.  Signature Recognition  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
49 3.3.13.4  Vulnerabilities  
There are unique vulnerabilities associated with signature dynamics:  
• Signature dynamics access control requires a digitizing tablet, motion sensitive stylus, 
or other capture  device that can become worn over time . 
• Since most users are not accustomed to signing on a digital tablet, their signatures may differ from those  placed with ink on paper.  This increases the potential for false 
rejecti on. 
• The user’s signature must be consistent from event to event.  Since the measured characteristics of the signature are not  purely physical, the user ’s behavior  can affect 
the ability of the system to verify identity more than most other biometric access 
control systems ; however,  this does not mean that an imposter can easily gain 
admittance . 
• Signing in a different position (e .g., s itting versus standing ) may cause the system to 
falsely reject an authorized user . 
• Individuals with muscular illnesses and people  who sign only with initials might have 
higher rejection rates.  
3.3.14   Multimodal  
Single biometric access control systems must often contend with noisy sensor data and unacceptable error rates.  Multimodal biometric systems 
provide  the ability to combine two or 
more  complementary modes for 
verification and identification , as 
shown in Figure 3- 26.  The most 
obvious reason for using multimodal biometrics instead of a single modality  
is to make access control operations more secure.  It seems logical that combining systems should make spoofing more difficult and should 
result in overall lower error rates.  There are ways to combine the outputs from biometric systems  to achieve this 
goal, which is a  process called fusion. 
The current challenge is to design a biometric access control syste m with 
as small an error rate as possible, that will cover the entire group of individual users, and that cannot be compromised under any reasonable scenario.  True multimodality implies the ability to analyze several biometric traits 
simultaneously, inste ad of analyzing different bi ometric traits one at a time.   One of the newest 
 
Figure 3 -26.  Multimodal Biometric System  

Access Control Technologies Handbook  
50 technologies available combines multiple modalities, such as finger vein and fingerprint, and 
captures and processes the two sets of biometric data at the same time using a single device.  
3.3.14.1  Operation  
Middle ware is a term used for a computer program that functions as a go between for two other 
programs.  Fusion i s typically performed in middle ware using proprietary techniques that weigh 
the output from multiple biometric detection sys tems on a predetermined scale based on the 
access control system’s use and facility’s need.  Some schemes can adjust the biometric detection signal weighting factors as a function of the individual user so that persons who cannot give a good sample for a particular biometric element can still use the system.  Fusion schemes can operate at the feature extraction level (combining extracted features), at the confidence level (combining matching scores), and at the abstract level (combining accept/reject decisi ons).  
In a multimodal scheme, multiple biometric systems send outputs to a single application that compares those outputs to a base reference.  This comparison occurs at different levels within the overall system depending on the proprietary structure of t he system  which results in generating 
the signal to grant or deny access . 
3.3.14.2  Applications  
Multimodal biometric access control systems are most feasible for very high -security situations.  
These systems may use characteristics from the same biometric attribute s or from different ones, 
but all samples are collected at the same time .  For example, face, fingerprint, and iris may be 
captured and weights assigned to the match score of each modality for a higher confidence match/no match decision.  Another example i s finger vein combined with fingerprint recognition.  
Consideration for selecting the modalities, sensors, and fusion approach must not only take 
facility security needs into account, but also convenience and the amount of user training  
required .  User acceptance is paramount to system use.  The best biometric system will become 
ineffective if it is difficult to use or easy to bypass using other means of access.  
3.3.14.3  Performance Metrics  
Operating performance metrics for multimodal systems are difficult to qua ntify since they 
depend on the single biometric systems selected and how they are combined.  In general, a multimodal system should exhibit lower FMR  and FNMR  rates  than any of its constituent parts 
would individually exhibit. 
3.3.14.4  Vulnerabilities  
The most seri ous vulnerability for multimodal systems relates to their complexity.  The 
combination of different biometric subsystems can be confusing for the user unless the 
implementation schemes make sense from a human factors and operations standpoint.  Systems that seem overly complex or restrictive for the anticipated level of security required should be 
closely scrutinized to ensure that facility requirements, as well as user needs , are being 
adequately addressed.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
51  Assistive Technology 3.4
Assistive technology in access control incorporates  products that allow  people with physical or 
cognitive impairments  to enter or exit a controlled area.   This also includes the process of 
selecting, locating , and using these technologies.  Assistive technology’s  use has improved 
engineering designs and well -planned user interfaces to help disabled individuals achieve 
previously unreachable goals.  Often an assistive technology  is simply an existing device or 
technology that has been modified to suit the abilities of a handicapped individual or group.  
While there is no single assistive technology  that can meet the requirements for all disabilities, 
the operation of many existing access control systems can be improved with assistive technology  
and applications of universal design techniques , which strive for flexibility, intuitive operation, 
and tolerance of errors and faults.  Disabled employees and other authorized facility users may be eligible to requ est reasonable accommodations under the ADA.  Assistive technology  is an 
important element of the design of any access control system.  
This section will briefly examine each of the access control technologies already reviewed to identify potential changes and modifications that could improve accessibility for people with some type s of impairment or disabilit y. 
3.4.1  Operation  
Assistive technology  can be installed in accordance with the ADA in newly constructed 
facilities, during some remodeling projects, and when required in special situations.  Installing a 
voice recognition system during a remodeling project to augment a fingerprint access control system is an example of an assistive technology  application for those who have lost limbs or 
have abraded fingertips.  Access control assets, procedur es, and the application of assistive 
technologies  should be audited periodically, especially during facility safety reviews and 
inspections . 
3.4.2  Applications  
• Barriers: f ixed and portable barriers can blend into the surroundings and become a 
safety hazard for p eople with visual impairments.  Barriers should be painted in high 
contrast color schemes to enhance visibility .  In some cases, it may be appropriate to 
add some type of audible proximity alarm.  
• Obstacles: t urnstiles, portals, and mantraps should be marke d with sufficient contrast 
so they can be easily seen by visually impaired persons.  The level of force used by 
powered equipment such as doors or turnstiles and the effort required to operate the equipment should be appropriate to the application.  Facili ty managers should consider 
how persons with restricted mobility or strength limitations will move through the obstacles and provide alternatives when necessary.  
• Bollards: f ixed and portable bollards often are large, heavy, stationary objects that 
exhibit some aesthetic or architectural design that contributes to the safety and beauty of the surroundings.  Bollards are most often used to restrict vehicle traffic, but allow pedestrian traffic to pass without restraint.  Generally, the minimum space between the bollards should be no less than 4 feet, to allow access for a person walking beside another using a wheelchair.  
Access Control Technologies Handbook  
52 • Guard Facilities: often people with limited hearing have difficulty communicating 
through Plexiglas or other safety barriers.  A telephone or  intercom is  an example of 
an assistive technology  that c ould be used in this situation.  
• ID C ards and Badges: m any agencies require that  ID cards and badges must remain 
visible at all times .  Several alternative attachment devices should be made available 
as required in certain situations .  For example, a person using health support 
equipment might prefer a clip -on badge to a lanyard badge, to avoid the badge 
becoming entangled with the support equipment. 
• Smart Cards and  Devices: c ard readers and keypads or other input devices should be 
within reach of wheelchair -bound persons and those with mobility limitations.  
Signage may be required near the reader to explain its operation.  Braille text or 
illustrated instructions may be neces sary for those with sensory or cognitive 
disabilities.  Auditory output, such as  a chime or buzzer, can be used to inform persons 
with visual disabilities that the access control system has cycled.  An intercom system at the access point can provide a link for furt her assistance when necessary.  
• Magnetic Stripe and Keycard Door Systems: a ssistive considerations for these systems 
are similar to those enumerated for smart cards and devices.  
• Key fob s: people with limited mobility often can use key fobs to unloc k doors and 
grant access to visitors and delivery personnel.  When fobs are used in this way, an intercom system at the access point improves the system’s utility and security.  Many fobs have a panic button that enhances the user ’s safety and security.  
• Biometric Systems: biometric access control systems present various challenges when 
assistive technology  solutions are required.  For any such system, a small percentage 
of the population will be unable to enroll because of occupation, illness, or injury.  When deploying a biometric access control system, it is essential to plan for 
alternative access control measures.  For example, if authentication is usually performed using a fingerprint biometric system, there should be an alternative authentication syste m for those with amputations or abraded and/or  callused fingers.  
An iris  recognition system could be an alternative in this example.  
3.4.3  Performance Metrics  
The U.S. Access Board is an independent federal agency that promotes equality for people with disabilities through leadership in accessible design and the development of accessibility guidelines and standards.  ADA Accessibility  Guidelines  (ADA AG) provides detailed guidance 
and specific standards for accessibility to buildings and facilities by individuals with disabilities under the ADA of 1990.  The publication should be consulted by agencies seeking to implement 
assistive tech nologies . 
3.4.4  Vulnerabilities  
Generally, the changes made to accommodate people with disabilities benefit everyone.  However, a ccess managers should be careful that accommodations made for disabled people do 
not enable others to bypass or otherwise compromise the system.

53 4. VENDOR SELECTION GUI DELINES  
Selecting an access control system vendor can be a challenge.  Professional industry support is 
available from a host of companies, some of which offer a full suite of services and products.  
Others may offer more specialized services as designers, manufacturers, suppl iers or authorized 
equipment dealers, installers, or integrators.  The access control market evolves continuously with many vendors both entering and leaving  the marketplace.  Organizations may have internal 
experts that can fill certain roles, but any new , expanded, or upgraded access control system will 
require engagement with some form of professional industry support.  
 Selection Criteria  4.1
Experienced vendors may provide invaluable expertise to organizations seeking upgrades and 
integrations of older technology access control systems ; however, some new vendors may have 
more specialized expertise in a particular emerging technology.  Determining the most important criteria prior to selection is a fundamental step in finding the best suited vendor.  Criteria can include the vendor’s previous experience and past performance with access control products and services, their level of sophistication with design, installation, and integration of access control components, technical support offered, and total cost. 
 Vendor Resources  4.2
Selecting a well -qualified and experienced vendor with the capabilities to meet specific 
requirements  will help increase the quality and performance of the overall access control  system.  
The following organizations’ websites provide inform ation on access control  system vendors, 
their related areas of expertise, and their contact information:
