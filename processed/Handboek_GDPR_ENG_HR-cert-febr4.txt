This handbook is the final outcome of the STAR II (SupporT small And 
medium enterprises on the data protection Reform II) research project, 
co-funded by the European Union within the scope of the Rights, Equality 
and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020 (REC-RDAT- TRAI-AG-2017), 
under Grant Agreement No. 814775.
The STAR II project was implemented by a partnership of the National 
Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (NAIH) 
(coordinator), the interdisciplinary Research Group on Law, Science, 
Technology & Society (LSTS) of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), and 
Trilateral Research Ltd (TRI IE) between August 2018 and December 
2020.
STAR II consortium members included academics with extensive 
theoretical background in privacy and data protection – Lina 
Jasmontaitė-Zaniewicz and Alessandra Calvi – of VUB-LSTS, researcher 
and practitioner from TRI IE – David Barnard-Wills – who provides 
multidisciplinary research and consultancy services in the field of data 
protection; and Renata Nagy – the representative of the Hungarian 
Data Protection Authority, who has been actively engaged in awareness 
raising activities for SMEs.  
The main goal of the project was to promote compliance with the 
General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, commonly 
referred to as GDPR, by assisting Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) 
and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). To this end, the STAR II 
project prepared a Guidance for DPAs on running hotline services 
dedicated to SMEs and the handbook on European data protection 
law for SMEs outlining obligations and good practices concerning the 
processing of personal data. The STARII project materials are available at 
www.star-project-2.eu.
The STAR II project is a follow-up of the STAR project that developed 
easily customizable training materials for data protection professionals, 
9
in particular Data Protection Offi   cers, who are responsible for awareness-
raising and the training of staff   involved in processing operations.

PREFACEPreface
The STAR II consortium has conceived this handbook as a tool which 
seeks to simplify the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This handbook has 
set itself a very high standard for helping SMEs to comply with their 
legal obligations. However, making the GDPR simple for SMEs is a task 
that cannot be solved by a handbook alone; it requires a long-term 
approach and concerted eff  orts from public authorities, business, and 
society. Nevertheless, this handbook is an important stepping-stone 
that explains some of the main features of the GDPR (e.g. its risk-based 
approach and legal provisions embedding it) in a simple language. 
It also provides case studies and practical examples to guide SMEs.
SMEs amount to approximately 99 percent of businesses in the European 
Union. They are responsible for a large share of employment, and 
contribute substantially to economic growth. Yet, compliance with the 
GDPR can be problematic for SMEs, whereas noncompliance can have 
important repercussions in terms of fines or loss of trust. Unfortunately, 
many SMEs are not as well equipped as large companies when it comes 
to dealing with the GDPR. Legal uncertainty and interpretation resulting 
from the GDPR’s risk-based approach constitute a problem for smaller 
companies, as they often lack the necessary internal resources and 
expertise. Many SMEs need to rely on external legal consultations to 
ensure that they are GDPR-compliant, which constitutes additional 
costs for them. Furthermore, formal aspects of the regulation, such as 
documentation requirements, can constitute an additional burden, due 
to high levels of bureaucracy associated with these obligations. 
At the same time, the questionable data processing and data collection 
practices of Big Tech companies continue. While the GDPR awarded 
individuals greater rights and provided a general framework for data 
protection in the EU, it failed to substantially change the behaviour of 
13
PREFACEBig Tech companies that exploit personal data for their ad-based business 
models. The majority of digital SMEs comprising the membership of 
European DIGITAL SME Alliance do not follow such ad-based business 
models, and thus pose far less risk to the fundamental rights of 
individuals. Nonetheless, they were aff  ected by the GDPR and had to 
implement its one-size-fits-all requirements, in spite of not having the 
same resources as large companies in terms of internal legal advice or 
finance. 
In addition, a harmonized European legal space in terms of data 
protection is still in the making, and important challenges remain that 
concern the way the GDPR is applied across Europe. Whereas data 
protection authorities (DPAs) should inform SMEs and raise awareness, 
according to studies carried out in the context of the STAR II project, 
less than one-third of EU DPAs provide specific guidance to SMEs. 
Also, the capability of the DPAs to fulfil their roles depends on diff  erent 
factors that can change according to national circumstances (i.e. how 
they are equipped in terms of resources and staff  ). This set-up leads 
to uncertainties for smaller companies as to how to handle personal 
data, and also prevents them from benefitting from an eff  ective uniform 
legal space in this area. Across Europe, DPAs and other supervisory 
authorities apply and interpret the GDPR diff  erently. This may sometimes 
even be the case within a single country when multiple bodies enforce 
data protection rules. Therefore, businesses are often uncertain as to 
whether they comply with the provisions of the GDPR to their fullest 
extent. Further, while organizations seek advice from DPAs for certainty, 
the authorities can often only direct SMEs to recommendations and 
expose the consequences of possible choices; the final decision on how 
to address the situation is left to the organization itself, which bears the 
legal consequences of this. 
As a representative of European small and medium enterprises in 
the digital sector, my organization welcomes clear and uniform rules 
which set the ground for a harmonized digital single market that allows 
companies, especially smaller ones, to operate and innovate in legal 
14
PREFACEclarity across EU internal borders and beyond. This handbook provides 
SMEs with important and clear guidance, and is therefore a welcome 
initiative to accompany SMEs on the path to better and uniform GDPR 
compliance and application across Europe.

Introduction
17Introduction
 Background
More than two years have passed since the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) became applicable in the European Economic Area 
(EEA), which encompasses the territory of the Member States of the 
European Union (EU) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
The first round of evaluation reports by the European Commission and 
the European Data Protection Board consider the GDPR to be a great 
success.1 Its harmonized rules for the processing of personal data have 
arguably improved data handling practices and enhanced individuals’ 
awareness regarding their rights.2 Furthermore, it is suggested that 
compliance with the GDPR can act as a competitive advantage, fostering 
consumer trust and providing new business opportunities. 
However, attaining compliance and unleashing such competitive 
advantages requires a sound understanding of personal data protection 
principles and other legal notions found in the EU data protection 
framework. This is extremely diffi   cult to achieve for smaller organiza-
tions, in particular, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While 
the processing of personal data for many SMEs is unavoidable, it is often 
not their core activity and, consequently, they lack the suffi   cient human 
or financial resources to achieve adequate compliance.3

employees, or to contact clients. CCTV systems at the premises of an SME in the 
footage also capture personal data.
Introduction
18Additionally, despite the barrage of available opinions and guidelines on 
the GDPR put together by regulators and data protection experts, there 
is a lack of practical, easy to understand and targeted guidance about 
data protection law for SMEs. Uncertainty over the interpretation of the 
revised data protection requirements is increased by those areas where 
national laws can diverge (‘derogate’) from certain GDPR provisions. 
Regulators do recognize the unique challenges that SMEs face in regard 
to GDPR compliance, and do assist when possible. However, Data 
Protection Authorities (DPAs) apply the GDPR irrespective of the size of 
an organization. The enforcement actions taken by several DPAs across 
Europe demonstrate that they are willing to fine SMEs they find in breach 
of data protection rules in a similar manner to larger enterprises. The 
most illustrative examples in this regard include the 15,000 EUR fine 
issued by the Belgian DPA in late 2019 to an SME for not complying with 
information obligations stemming from the GDPR when using cookies;4
a 20,000 EUR fine issued by French DPA to a translation company for 
continuously filming its employees at their workstations and thereby 
breaching the data protection rights of employees;5 and a 5,000 EUR 
fine for a shipping company that did not conclude a data processing 
agreement with one of its business partners.6
Structure 
With this background in mind, the STAR II consortium prepared this 
handbook to help SMEs meet core GDPR requirements. Diff  erent

Introduction
19chapters of the handbook summarize the main requirements that SMEs 
have to abide by to lawfully process personal data in the EU.
Chapter 1 (Navigating support section)  provides an overview of 
the main public and private actors in the European data protection 
landscape. It describes the roles and responsibilities of public bodies 
and then explains how SMEs could use their support to adhere to GDPR 
requirements. As the scope of this handbook is limited solely to topics 
of particular concern for SMEs, it is important to be able to navigate 
among other available resources that could potentially facilitate GDPR 
compliance.
Chapter 2 (Personal data protection basics) explains the scope of data 
protection law and the scope of its application to SMEs. The chapter 
introduces concepts and principles that form the crux of personal data 
protection legal framework by answering the most commonly asked 
questions. Mastering this knowledge is essential when setting out a 
compliance strategy. The list of commonly asked questions is based on 
the NAIH’s experience of running a hotline dedicated to SMEs.
Chapter 3 (The theory and practice of a risk-based approach to personal 
data protection)  makes the aforementioned core concept of EU data 
protection law intelligible, subsequently explaining the GDPR provisions 
embedding it. In particular, the chapter addresses the responsibility of 
the controller (Article 24), principles of data protection by design and 
default (Article 25), documentation obligations (Article 30), security 
requirements (Article 32), personal data breach notifications (Articles 
33 and 34), data protection impact assessment (Article 35) and the 
prior consultation procedure (Article 36). The final two sections of 
the chapter reflect on the use of codes of conduct (Article 40) and 
certifications (Articles 42 and 43) as tools that may make it easier for 
SMEs to comply with the GDPR.
Each section provides practical examples, suggestions and recom-
mendations for further reading. Where available, we refer to relevant 
decisions by DPAs. This handbook is predominantly based on guidance 
documents issued by European data protection authorities. 
Introduction
20Chapter 4 (SMEs and employees’ data) addresses data protection 
concerns for SMEs when processing their employees’ personal data.
Method
The above-mentioned topics were found to be of particular concern for 
SMEs during the span of the STAR II project, and therefore form the 
exclusive focus of this handbook. More specifically, the project carried 
out interviews with representatives of 18 DPAs, 22 SME associations and 
11 SMEs. Some observations were extracted from an additional 52-60 
responses of SMEs to an online survey. Further substantive input was 
provided by the NAIH’s hotline dedicated to SMEs, which responded to 
queries from SMEs between 15 March 2019 and 15 March 2020. 
Furthermore, following the suggestions of diff  erent stakeholders 
interviewed by the STAR II consortium in 2019,7 the handbook: 
»includes examples and provides references to templates and 
guidance developed by various DPAs across the EU;
»introduces the background of risk-based provisions and then 
provides references to good practices, where available;
»suggests how SMEs can achieve compliance with the GDPR and 
how to transform this into a competitive advantage; 
»targets a wide range of SMEs, regardless of their business sectors; 
and
»dismantles some common misconceptions about the GDPR.

Introduction
21Bringing in added value
Many DPAs have published guidance on GDPR compliance, some of 
which is specifically addressed to SMEs.8 However, SMEs interviewed 
during the STAR II project shared criticism of this material and reported 
low levels of uptake and use. Available DPA guidance documents 
were criticized for being overly generic and focusing on legal theory. 
Respondents pointed out that organizations must infer from them, and 
make assumptions about how the GDPR should be interpreted in their 
specific situation.9 Some of the respondents noted that DPA guidance 
often raise more questions than they answer, and can be hard to follow 
in practice. Furthermore, some SME representatives shared the opinion 
that DPA guidance arrived too late, i.e. after the time the legislation 
should have come into eff  ect.
Building on these insights, the handbook goes beyond a mere 
description of GDPR provisions and obligations stemming from them. 
It seeks to provide SME representatives with a set of proactive measures 
that were put forward by diff  erent DPAs and bodies across Europe. To 
make this handbook easy to approach, it is based around questions 
an SME representative might ask. In addition, it provides exhaustive 
references to other publicly available (open access) resources to further 
explain topics.
Target audience
The handbook is addressed to SMEs. The term ‘SME’ includes a wide 
range of enterprises (e.g. a self-employed person, a family firm, 
partnerships and associations), which fall within the following criteria: 
they employ fewer than 250 persons and have an annual turnover not 
exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not 
8 See 1. Navigating support.
9 Footnote 7.
Introduction
22exceeding EUR 43 million.10 Small enterprises, employing fewer than 50 
persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance sheet total 
do not exceed EUR 10 million, and microenterprises, employing fewer 
than 10 persons and whose annual turnover and/or annual balance 
sheet total do not exceed EUR 2 million, also fall within this range.
SMEs are not all the same. Recognizing this, the handbook is primarily 
addressed to enterprises that face structural barriers (e.g. lack of human 
and financial resources) in attaining compliance with the GDPR, and for 
which personal data processing is an auxiliary activity. More specifically, 
the handbook targets SME owners and their representatives dealing 
with data protection matters. These may include internal and external 
Data Protection Offi   cers (DPOs). The handbook may be useful for SME 
associations and their memberships, as well as start-ups. If you are an 
SME and your business relies on the use of personal data, then it is 
important that you seek out data protection advice tailored to your 
activities.

1. Navigating support1. Navigating support 
People working in data protection often refer to the process of attaining 
compliance with the GDPR as a journey: ‘an act of travelling from one 
place to another, especially when they are far apart’ and also ‘a long 
and often diffi   cult process of personal change and development’.11
Similarly, adhering to the GDPR requirements is not a one-off   project. 
It is a challenging and continuous process. It requires organizations to 
consider their data handling practices and to identify risks arising from 
these. While doing so, individual specificities and the contexts in which 
enterprises function and process personal data must also be carefully 
evaluated.
The GDPR is a principle-based regulation and it leaves the issue of 
how to devise a compliance strategy to the discretion of the individual 
enterprise. While laying out such a strategy, prioritizing and planning 
for various measures, it is important to understand that there is plenty 
of support available. Some of this is provided by public authorities, 
while yet more has been created by the private sector. When informing 
yourself, however, it is important to be able to distinguish among 
resources and to build on reliable guidance. 
For this reason, this chapter provides an overview of the main public and 
private actors of the European data protection landscape. It describes 
roles and responsibilities of public bodies and explains how SMEs could 
use their support to adhere to GDPR requirements. The chapter also 
introduces professional organizations.

1. Navigating support1.1. National and regional Data Protection 
Authorities (DPAs)
National and regional Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), also known 
as supervisory authorities, are responsible for the monitoring and 
consistency of GDPR application. Each Member State has at least one 
supervisory authority.12 However, while France, Hungary and Italy 
have only one supervisory authority, Germany and Spain have regional 
authorities in addition to a central authority. This is a consequence 
of their federal or devolved constitutional structure. Consequently, 
competences are then split between central and regional authorities. 
DPAs act as enforcers, ombudsmen, auditors, consultants to policy 
advisors, negotiators and educators.13 The latter role concerns raising 
public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and 
rights in relation to the processing of personal data. To this end, DPAs, 
individually or jointly (e.g. as the European Data Protection Board), 
issue authoritative guidance on GDPR concepts and provisions. 
Some guidance has been addressed to SMEs specifically. Based on the 
information provided by the STAR II interviews with DPAs as well as desktop 
research of all EU DPA websites, it appears that slightly fewer than one-third 
of EU DPAs currently provide GDPR guidance that is specifically tailored to 
SMEs. Upon the last review, this included the DPAs from Belgium (Autorité 
de protection des données - Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit),14 France

1. Navigating supportSUGGESTION
In principle, because the GDPR applies across the EU, an SME can use 
templates and tools for GDPR compliance developed by any European 
DPA, regardless of the place of its establishment. However, it must be 
considered that some national rules for processing personal data may 
diff  er. Several GDPR provisions foresee a possibility of derogations 
and exceptions.
1.2. The European Data Protection Board 
(EDPB)
The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) is an independent European 
body that contributes to the consistent application of data protection 
rules throughout the EU. It promotes cooperation between national 
DPAs. The EDPB is made up of the representatives from the European 
DPAs and the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Its decisions 
concerning cases under the consistency mechanism, certifications and 
codes of conduct are legally binding. 
With the entry into force of the GDPR, the EDPB replaced the Article 
29 Working Party (WP29) that in a similar composition, albeit in a 
solely advisory capacity, addressed issues relating to the protection of 
privacy and personal data until 25 May 2018.23 Some of WP29 opinions 
concerning the GDPR’s application were endorsed by the EDPB. Other 
WP29 opinions may be used to understand key concepts of European 
data protection laws. 
The EDPB regularly issues opinions and guidance clarifying certain aspects 
of European data protection laws. These documents are not legally

individual consultancy services, the general guidance provided by 
this body can be useful for SMEs.24 For example, the EDPB adopted 
guidelines on the concepts of controller and processor, on the use of 
consent, and on the application of data protection by design and by 
default principles. Some guidance focuses on specific activities, such 
as the processing of personal data through video devices or targeting 
social media users.25
1.3. The European Data Protection 
Supervisor (EDPS)
The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) acts as the DPA for EU 
institutions, bodies, offi   ces and agencies.26 Similarly to the EDPB, the 
EDPS issues (non-legally-binding) opinions and general guidance upon 
various aspects of European data protection law. While such guidance is 
addressed to European institutions, bodies, offi   ces and agencies (e.g. the 
European Commission or Europol), it provides practical advice that can 
be adapted accordingly to the reality and needs of SMEs. For example, 
the EDPS has issued guidelines on the use of cloud computing services 
and guidelines, on personal data and electronic communications in the 
EU institutions (eCommunications guidelines), and on security measures 
for personal data processing.27

documents, some of which are specifically addressed to SMEs. These 
include a Cloud Security Guide for SMEs, a handbook on Security of 
Personal Data Processing specific to SMEs, and Guidelines for SMEs 
on the security of personal data processing.29 These resources can be 
useful in meeting the technical security requirements under the GDPR.

supporting national data protection authorities in their eff  orts to reach 
out to individuals and SMEs. Some of these projects have provided 
guidance and training materials in the national languages of member 
states.32 For example, guidance has been provided in Danish, Dutch, 
French, Icelandic, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Slovenian. Within the scope 
of such EU-funded initiatives, guidance in English was also provided.

312. Personal data 
protection basics
2.1. What is personal data and its 
processing? 
Understanding the concepts of personal data and its  processing is 
fundamental for compliance with the GDPR.36 Only the processing of 
personal data is regulated. This means that if the data processed is not 
personal, the GDPR does not apply.
A piece of information constitutes personal data if it relates to an 
individual human being, directly or indirectly, and hence such a piece of 
information is protected by law against misuse. In contrast, if a piece of 
information cannot be attributed to an individual, its free circulation is 
actually encouraged by law.37
36 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal 
data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC 
(General Data Protection Regulation), OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, 1-88 http://data.europa.
eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj . 
37 Cf. e.g. Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public sector information, OJ L 172, 
26.6.2019, 56–83 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/1024/oj .
2. Personal data protection basics
32EXAMPLE
Non-personal data may concern data about cultural works and 
artefacts — for example titles and authors — generally collected and 
held by galleries, libraries, archives and museums. It may concern 
data that is produced within the scope of scientific research, from 
astronomy to zoology. It may also include public sector information 
(PSI) and open data, encompassing data produced by statistical 
offi   ces, information related to the presence of pollutants in the air, 
and governments’ accounts.38
The GDPR includes some exemptions. Following the so-called ‘house-
hold exemption’, the GDPR does not apply to personal data processing 
carried out by a natural person in the course of a purely personal 
or household activity, which has no connection to a professional or 
commercial activity. This exemption is interpreted narrowly. 
EXAMPLES
An individual takes a family picture for their own enjoyment.
Two co-workers exchanging their phone numbers for reasons that 
are not related to work are not bound by the GDPR. Whereas, if the 
exchange of phone numbers occurred in the context of an SME’s 
business activities, the household exemption does not apply.39
Even if an SME processes only a single piece of personal data in the 
context of its business activities (e.g. a name of a contractual partner 
or their contact person to fulfil contracts of service), this processing is 
still subject to the GDPR. 
38 Open Knowledge Foundation, ‘What is open?’ https://okfn.org/opendata/.
39 Article 2(2)(c) GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
33Personal data is any information related to an identified or identifiable 
natural person; such a person is called a  data subject.40 The definition 
of personal data is very broad.
Any information encompasses both objective information (e.g. 
identity card or social security numbers, results of blood analysis), and 
subjective one (e.g. opinions and assessments about a client and/or an 
employee).41
Identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, 
an online identifier or factors specific to the physical, physiological, 
genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural 
person are considered personal data.
Information related to a natural person means that it is about that 
natural person, or objects, events, or processes that are somehow 
connected to that natural person.42
EXAMPLES
The service register of a car held by a mechanic contains information 
(personal data) related to diff  erent data subjects. For example, the 
name of the mechanic that worked on the car, the plate number and 
the engine number of the vehicle that can be linked to the owner of 
the serviced car.43
The call logs of offi   ce phones may contain personal data of diff  erent 
subjects, such as the employees of the company performing the

potential clients of the company or administrative and other staff   
using the phone).44
‘Smart metering systems’ collect personal data when keeping a 
record of electricity consumption. Such data can reveal habits and 
behavioural data that may allow the identification of an individual.45
In principle, contacting a company (i.e. a legal person) with a direct 
marketing off  er is not an activity subject to the GDPR, because the 
protection of the data of legal persons, such as companies, does 
not fall within the scope of the Regulation.46 However, there are 
situations where this may not be the case. For example, where the 
name of an entity derives from that of a natural person, or where a 
corporate email account is used by one or several employees, whose 
identification may be possible from behaviour associated with that 
email account.47
To determine the identifiability of an individual, you have to consider 
all the means reasonably likely to be used to perform the identification. 
Factors to be considered include the capabilities of available technology 
at the time of the processing and technological developments, as well 
as the costs and the amount of time required for identification.48
Direct identification usually occurs by name. In turn, indirect identification 
is often based on a combination of several pieces of information.49

2. Personal data protection basics
35The possibility of identifying individuals could be aff  ected by the 
application of pseudonymization and anonymization techniques to their 
personal data. 
Pseudonymization is a form of processing of personal data in such a 
way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific 
data subject without the use of additional information. Such additional 
information is to be stored and maintained separately, and is subject 
to technical and organizational measures that ensure that the personal 
data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.50
EXAMPLE
In the case of pseudonymization, personal data such as name, date of 
birth, sex, address, etc. is replaced by a pseudonym. Pseudonymization 
techniques include encryption with a secret key, hash function, 
tokenization, etc.51
Anonymization as such is not defined by the GDPR. However, the 
Regulation clarifies that anonymous information encompasses: 
»information that does not relate to an identified or identifiable 
natural person; or
»personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data 
subjects is not, or no longer, identifiable.52

51 Article 29 Working Party, ‘Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques’

52 Recital 26 GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
36EXAMPLE
Anonymization techniques include two main approaches, namely 
randomization and generalization. The former encompasses methods 
that alter the accuracy of the data, such as noise addition and 
permutation. The latter includes practices that generalize, or dilute, 
the attributes of a data subject by modifying their scale (e.g. a region 
rather than a city, a month rather than a week), such as aggregation 
and k-anonymity, l-diversity/t closeness.53
The main diff  erence between pseudonymized and anonymized data 
concerns the applicability of the GDPR to them. Even if pseudonymized 
data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject (unless 
additional information is used) the data subject remains indirectly 
identifiable.54 That is why pseudonymized data is considered personal 
data, and therefore subject to the GDPR.55
Conversely, when all identifying elements are eliminated and data is 
anonymized, the GDPR is no longer applicable.56 However, in practice, 
distinguishing between pseudonymized and anonymized data may be 
diffi   cult, especially when many services or technologies use the term 
‘anonymized’ when they actually mean ‘pseudonymized’.

54 Footnote 30, 94.
55 Footnote 41, 8.
56 Cf Recital 26, footnote 30, 93.
2. Personal data protection basics
37SUGGESTION
When an SME decides to rely on anonymization techniques, it must 
consider whether full anonymization is achieved. If in doubt, it is 
best practice to consider data as personal data. In this way, higher 
protection is aff  orded to individuals to whom the data may refer to.
You may then question the added value of pseudonymization. Pseudo-
nymization can be a technical measure to provide data security or to 
reduce the risks to data subjects.
It has been argued that current methods for anonymizing data still 
leave individuals at risk of being re-identified, and that the distinction 
between anonymized data and pseudonymized personal data is fluid, 
as the re-identification of individuals largely depends on the context.57
The concept of  processing encompasses any operations performed 
on personal data, either manually or automatically, such as storage, 
recording, deletion, transfer, consultation, combination, etc.58

»racial or ethnic origin;
»political opinions;
»religious or philosophical beliefs; 
»trade union membership; 
»genetic data;59
»biometric data (where used for identification purposes);60

characteristics of a natural person that gives unique information about the 
physiology or the health of that natural person, and which results, in particular, 
from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question 
(Article 4(13) GDPR).
60 ‘Biometric data’ means personal data resulting from specific technical processing 
relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural 
person, which allows or confirms the unique identification of that natural person, 
such as facial images or dactyloscopic data (Article 4(14) GDPR).

39»data concerning health;61
»a person’s sex life; and

When processing special categories of personal data, the controller must 
be able to select an appropriate legal ground for processing foreseen in 
Article 9 of the GDPR, following which:
»they have explicit consent of a concerned data subject;
»the processing is necessary for employment, social security and 
social protection (if authorized by law);
»the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of data 
subject or others;
»the processor is a not-for-profit body processing such data about 
its members;
»the personal data has been made public by the data subject;
»the processing is necessary for legal claims or judicial acts;
»reasons of substantial public interest (with a basis in law);63
»the processing is necessary for health or social care (with a basis 
in law);
»the processing is necessary for public health (with a basis in law); 
or
»the processing is necessary for archiving, research and statistics 
(with a basis in law).

health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which 
reveals information about their health status (Article 4(15) GDPR).

63 Consider national law implementing the GDPR. An overview of national laws 
implementing the GDPR is provided in Annex I.
2. Personal data protection basics
40SUGGESTIONS
When processing special categories of personal data, consider scale. 
If the processing of special categories of personal data is carried out 
on a large scale, a controller is required to conduct a data protection 
impact assessment (DPIA). 
The notion of ‘large scale’ is contextual. Therefore, consider if the 
processing includes lots of people (a significant proportion of the 
population); or if it results in a large volume data; or if it is extensive 
and covers a large geographical area; or if it could have significant 
eff  ects on individuals. If the processing meets one or more of the 
aforementioned criteria, then it likely counts as a large scale.

412.2. What are the possible roles for an SME 
in the processing operations? 
The obligations of an SME under the GDPR depend on what they do 
with the personal data they process. Three scenarios can be envisioned. 
First, an SME may act as a data controller  (or controller) and process 
personal data by itself. Second, it may instruct another entity – a data 
processor  (or processor) – to process personal data on its behalf, while 
still acting as a controller. Third, it may process personal data on behalf 
of another entity, and in this way act as a processor. 
Both controllers and processors must comply with specific rules,64
but the responsibilities of the controller are higher. Controllers bear 
the ultimate responsibility for the processing of personal data and, in 
principle, can be held liable for damages arising from any infringement 
of the GDPR.
Processors can only be held liable if they fail to comply with obligations 
of the GDPR specifically directed to them OR if they acted outside of, or 
contrary to, the lawful instructions of the controller.65
64 For example, processors must be able to demonstrate compliance, keeping 
records of processing activities; ensure the security of processing, implementing 
technical and organizational measures; nominate a DPO in certain situations; notify 
data breaches to the controller. See FRA/ECtHR/EDPS, Handbook on European 
data protection law (Publications Offi   ce of the European Union 2018), 101, 102. 
Compared with the previous Data Protection Directive, the obligations posed by the 
GDPR on processors have increased. See Gabel, D. and Hickman, T., ‘Chapter 11:

2. Personal data protection basics
42As regards the roles in the processing operations: 
1. an SME is a controller when, alone or jointly with others, it 
determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal 
data. The purposes of processing data define ‘why’ the personal 
data is being processed and the means of the processing define 
‘how’ the data is processed.66 If an SME determines the types of 
data to be processed, the period of the processing, third party 
access and the legal basis of the processing, then it is a controller.67
EXAMPLE
An individual beautician is operating within the premises of a spa and 
wellness centre. The two are diff  erent legal entities, but they agree to 
enter into a partnership and set up a common fidelity programme for 
their clients (e.g. for every spa entry, 5% discount at the beautician; 
for EUR 40 spent at the beautician, 5% discount on spa entry). 
To join the common fidelity programme, clients are requested to give 
their name, surname and their email address.
For the personal data processed within the common fidelity 
programme, the spa and the beautician are joint controllers.
2. An SME is deemed to be a processor when it processes personal 
data on behalf of a controller following the controller’s instructions. 
The processor is conceived rather as an ‘agent’ or ‘delegate’ of the 
controller, allowed to process personal data only in accordance 
with the instructions of the controller.68 A processor must be

and ‘processor’’ (16 February 2010) https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/

68 Footnote 65, Ibid.
2. Personal data protection basics
43legally separate from the controller.69 Upon an authorization of 
the controller, a processor may engage with a sub-processor .70
Controllers can decide either to process data by themselves 
(internally) or to outsource this activity to a processor.
EXAMPLE
If an employee of a pet shop is tasked with sending off  ers via mail to 
clients, the processing occurs internally. When the employee is acting 
within the scope of his/her duties as an employee, the employee is 
not a processor, but an agent of the controller itself.71
If the pet shop relied on a marketing company for the same activity, 
then the pet shop would be a controller and the marketing company a 
processor. The marketing company might suggest ways to process the 
personal data, but it would be the pet shop that makes the decision.
3. An SME is a recipient when personal data is disclosed to it, whether 
by a third party (namely, an entity that is not a data subject, a 
controller, or a processor)72 or not. The Regulation does not lay 
down specific obligations or responsibilities for recipients and third 
parties. However, if a third party or a recipient begins to process the 
personal data received for its own purposes, it shall be considered

44a controller in regard to any processing operation on the personal 
data carried out for its own purposes.73
EXAMPLE
An art gallery sells a sculpture and needs to ship it to the buyer’s 
address. To do so, the art gallery communicates to the courier the 
surname and home address of the client. In this case, the courier is a 
third-party recipient.
Who counts as a processor or controller is determined by the practical 
reality of what is happening with the personal data.74 An entity that 
determines means and purposes of data processing is a data controller, 
regardless of what it might be formally termed (for example, in a 
contract). The role of an SME may change depending on the processing 
operations. It may be possible that an SME acts as a processor for 
certain datasets and as a data controller for others.
EXAMPLE
SME1 off  ers advertisement and direct marketing services to other 
companies. SME1 concludes a contract with SME2, whereby SME1 
commits to provide advertising to the clients of SME2. In this case, 
SME1 is the processor – it acts on the instructions of SME2. SME2 is 
the data controller and therefore bears the overall responsibility for 
the processing. However, if SME1, obtains consent from the clients 
of SME2, and then uses SME2’s client database for another purpose

and processor in the GDPR’ (2 September 2020)  https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/

74 Footnote 67, 9.
2. Personal data protection basics
45(e.g. promoting the products of SME3), SME1 is treated as the data 
controller for this data processing activity.
A jeweller concludes a contract with a security company, which, after 
installing cameras at the premises of the jeweller, also monitors them. 
The security company and its personnel monitoring the footage act as 
a processor, and the jeweller remains the controller of this processing. 
If the security company exceeds the instructions of the jeweller (e.g. 
it stores recordings without being requested to do so), then it is 
considered to be the data controller. It is also likely to be in breach of 
the contract and process personal data unlawfully.
If the security company simply installs the cameras, then it neither 
qualifies as a processor nor as a controller.
The relationships between controllers and processors are governed 
by a contract. In other words, if a controller works with a processor or 
with another controller, a written and binding contract (called a data 
processing agreement) should be concluded. This contract must describe 
in detail the reciprocal obligations and rights, in addition to subject 
matter, nature, purpose, duration of the processing, types of personal 
data and categories of data subjects.75 This data processing agreement 
must be concluded before the actual data processing takes place.
If a processor engages a sub-processor , the same data protection 
obligations as listed in the agreement between the controller and the 
(original) processor apply.76
75 Articles 28(3) and (9) GDPR.
76 Article 28(4) GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
46The contract between joint controllers specifies roles and responsibilities 
of the joint controllers, including the ones concerning data subjects’ rights.77
SUGGESTION
The European Commission and DPAs may create or adopt s tandard 
contractual clauses  with regard to data processing agreements 
between controller and processor, and processor and sub-processor 
based in the EU or in third countries. DPA clauses must be approved 
by the EDPB.
These would essentially be templates for good practices in how to set 
up a contractual agreement between a controller and processor. In 
the event that a controller or a processor uses approved contractual 
clauses, only adaptation is possible.
When drafting a data processing agreement, it is worth consulting the 
website of the DPA where the SME is established to see if contract
templates are available in the local language.

2. Personal data protection basics
492.3. What are the principles applicable to the 
processing of personal data?
Principles can be understood as general norms embedding values that 
are particularly important within a legal system.79 The GDPR contains six 
principles governing the processing of personal data to which controllers 
are required to adhere. These are:80
1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency 
Lawfulness means that there must be a legal basis (or ground) for 
processing personal data.81 Fairness can be linked to ethical personal 
data processing, in the sense personal data must be handled in ways 
that people would reasonably expect, and not used in ways that 
have unjustified adverse eff  ects upon them.82 Transparency requires 
informing the data subjects in clear and plain language as to how their 
data is being used, and what the risks, rules, safeguards, and rights 
connected to the processing of personal data are.83
2. Purpose limitation
Purpose limitation means that any processing of personal data must be 
done for a well-defined specific purpose, identified before the beginning 
of processing. Any further processing must be compatible with the 
original purpose.84 This is the principle that prevents collection of 
personal data ‘just in case’, without any outline as to how it will be used.

83 Footnote 30, 118.
84 Idem, 122.
2. Personal data protection basics
503. Data minimization
Data minimization entails using only the data that is adequate, relevant 
and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it has been 
collected and/or further processed.85
4. Accuracy
Accuracy requires that personal data must be checked regularly and 
kept up to date, and that inaccurate data is promptly erased or corrected 
(‘rectified’ in GDPR terminology).86
5. Storage limitation 
Storage limitation requires the deletion or anonymization of personal 
data as soon as it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was 
collected.87
6. Integrity and confidentiality
Integrity and confidentiality are related to data security. They imply that 
appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure personal 
data and prevent data breaches must be set in place.88
Controllers are accountable for demonstrating compliance with the 
six principles. For this purpose, SMEs need to put in place appropriate 
technical and organizational measures, and be able to demonstrate 
what they did and its eff  ectiveness, when requested.89

2. Personal data protection basics
51SUGGESTION
Judges invoke legal principles such as these to interpret laws and fill 
in the actual or potential legal gaps when addressing legal disputes.90
Similarly, data protection principles may support SMEs in better under-
standing the other provisions of the GDPR that they are required to 
comply with. For example, the obligation of the data controller to 
provide information about the processing of personal data to a data 
subject91is one of the ways in which the GDPR puts into practice the 
principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency.
2.4. What are the possible legal bases for 
personal data processing? 
2.4.1. Background
To process personal data lawfully, meaning in accordance with the 
principle of lawfulness, SMEs need to specify a legal basis (legal ground). 
The Article 6 of the GDPR foresees these legal bases:
»the data subject consented to the processing; 
»the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to 
which the data subject is a party;
»the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation 
existing upon the controller;
»the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of data 
subjects or of another person;
»the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried 
out by the data controller in the public interest or in exercising 
offi   cial authority; and
90 Footnote 79.
91 See 2.5 What are data subjects’ rights?
2. Personal data protection basics
52»the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests 
of controllers or third parties, insofar as they are not overridden by 
the interests or fundamental rights of the data subjects.
2.4.2. How to choose among diff  erent legal bases?
The choice of appropriate legal ground depends on the circumstances 
of the processing operation. 
Consent 
Consent can be given by the data subjects with a statement (written, 
oral, video, audio, etc.) or an affi   rmative action (a click, typing a digit, 
etc., but not with a pre-filled answer). The consent can be obtained 
electronically, as the GDPR does not specify any form. However, the data 
controller must be able to prove that the data subject has consented.
To be valid, consent needs to be a  freely given , informed , specific 
and unambiguous  indication of the data subject’s wishes to have their 
personal data processed. 
As consent is freely given , it can be withdrawn at any time by the 
data subjects, without any detriment.92 Examples of detriments are 
disadvantage, deception, intimidation, coercion or significant negative 
consequences.93 Negligible negative consequences for data subjects do 
not undermine their consent. 
If consent is bundled up as a non-negotiable part of terms and 
conditions, or if it is used in a situation of imbalance of powers (e.g. in 
an employment context), it is presumed to have not been freely given.
92 Recital 42 GDPR.
93 European Data Protection Board, ‘Guidelines 05/2020 on consent under Regulation 
2016/679’ (4 May 2020) https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_
guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf para 46, 47.
2. Personal data protection basics
53EXAMPLES
A minimarket off  ers clients a personal card for discounts. In this case, 
the minimarket can process the personal data of its clients on the 
basis of their consent, because not enjoying extra discounts is a minor 
negative consequence.94
A company launches a fitness app. In the Terms and Conditions of the 
app, it is stated that users must consent to the processing of name, 
surname, date of birth, weight, dietary requirements, and geolocation 
data. 
In this case, the consent form shall be separated from the Terms and 
Conditions. Furthermore, the user should be able to choose whether 
they want to share all of the information requested or only some of 
it, as not all information is necessary for the functioning of the app.
Informed consent means that data subjects have to understand what 
they are agreeing to. Therefore, data subjects at minimum need to be 
given information concerning: 
»identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing; 
»(the type of) personal data that will be processed; and
»existence of the right to withdraw consent.95
SUGGESTION
When presenting a consent form, the data controller is required to use 
clear and plain language. A lengthy consent form full of legalese and 
technical terms does not count as informed consent.
94 Footnote 30, 145.
95 Footnote 93, para 64, 65.
2. Personal data protection basics
54Specific consent means that, if the data processing is performed for 
several purposes, the consent must be obtained with regards to each of 
the purposes. This is called granularity of the consent. 
EXAMPLE
A sports centre would like to collect customers’ email addresses in 
order to send them a monthly newsletter concerning new courses and 
training activities. 
At the same time, the sports centre would also like to share customers’ 
details with other partner companies (e.g. a company specialized in 
fitness clothing and a company specialized in supplements). In this 
case, the sports centre has to request consent for the two purposes 
separately, i.e. sending the newsletter and sharing the email addresses 
with the partners.
Unambiguous means that it must be obvious that the data subject has 
consented to the particular processing. Actions such as scrolling or 
swiping through a webpage cannot be considered affi   rmative actions 
(unless the user is asked to draw a figure with the cursor to give 
consent or similar), as they cannot be distinguished from other forms of 
interaction with the webpage.96
A mere ‘no objection’ to the processing cannot count as affi   rmative action.
96 Idem, para 8.
2. Personal data protection basics
55EXAMPLE
A catering service requires clients to create an online account to make 
orders and deliveries. 
To finalize the registration, the client is shown three tick boxes saying, 
‘I agree with the terms and conditions’, ‘I consent to the processing 
of personal data’, and ‘I agree to receive marketing communication’. 
If the boxes are already ticked by default, then consent is not valid. 
The controller has to develop three diff  erent boxes to ensure that 
by default only personal data which is necessary for each specific 
purpose of the processing is processed.
When so-called ‘information society services’ (i.e. contracts and other 
services that are concluded or transmitted online) are off  ered directly to 
a child ,97 and consent is used as a legal basis, the caregiver must also 
consent. The GDPR foresees that parental consent is needed where the 
child is below the age of 16 years. However, the age requirement for 
consent may be as low as 13 years old and, therefore, national laws or 
guidance of DPAs must be consulted.98
97 The notion of child changes depending on national law. The GDPR considers 
as children those under 16 years old, but it allows member states to lower the 
threshold to as low as 13 years old. 
98 van der Hof, S., Lievens, E. and Milkaite, I., ‘The Protection of Children’s Personal 
Data in a Data-Driven World: A Closer Look at the GDPR from a Children’s Rights 
Perspective’ in Liefaard, T., Rap, S. and Rodrigues, P . (eds.), Monitoring Children’s 
Rights in the Netherlands. 30 Years of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(Leiden University Press 2020).
2. Personal data protection basics
56EXAMPLE
Italy and Austria have set the age limit for a minor to give consent for 
provision of information society services at 14 years old. In Germany, 
this threshold is 16 years, whereas some countries set the threshold 
to 13 years.99
SUGGESTION
Using consent as a legal basis for processing personal data is not 
always possible or desirable. First of all, demonstrating that consent 
was freely given, informed, specific and unambiguous can actually be 
quite challenging. Secondly, consent can be withdrawn at any time. 
SMEs should consider using other legal bases where these would be 
appropriate.

Contractual relationship
In certain cases, the processing of personal data is necessary for 
performing (or entering) a contract to which the data subject is a party. 
99 Footnote 31.
2. Personal data protection basics
57EXAMPLE
An online shop needs to process information about customers (e.g. 
addresses) to deliver its products. In this case, the legal basis for 
the processing could be the performance of the purchase contract 
between the shop and the customer. An address is clearly necessary 
here, but other information might also count as necessary for the 
contract in other circumstances, for example, making sure a customer 
buying alcohol is old enough to do so.
Compliance with a legal obligation
In certain cases, the processing of personal data is necessary for the 
data controller to comply with a legal obligation. Such a legal obligation 
may originate from either EU or Member State law. The law itself 
will determine the purposes of the processing, the specifications for 
determining the controller, the type of personal data processed, the 
data subjects concerned, and the entities to which data will be disclosed. 
Typically, if an SME is required by law to do something with personal 
data, the GDPR does not prevent them from meeting that obligation.
EXAMPLES
When entrepreneurs share the personal data of customers with tax 
authorities for fiscal purposes, the legal basis for the processing is 
compliance with a legal obligation.
When employers communicate to the competent national authority 
information about their employees for social security purposes, the 
legal basis for the processing is compliance with a legal obligation.
2. Personal data protection basics
58Vital interests of data subjects or of another person
In certain cases, processing personal data is necessary to protect the 
vital interests of data subjects or of another person. This legal ground 
allows processing in situations of life and death, where the right to 
personal data protection is overridden by the right to life. 
EXAMPLE
In the event of a workplace accident, the employer may share with the 
emergency doctors the personal data about the injured employee.
Public interest or exercise of an offi   cial authority vested in the 
data controller
In certain cases, the processing of personal data is necessary for the 
data controller to perform a task carried in the public interest or to 
exercise offi   cial authority.
Exceptionally, an SME can be entrusted, under the legal regime 
applicable to it, with the performance of services of public interest or 
with an offi   cial authority. If, for the performance of these tasks, the SME 
is required to process personal data, the public interest and the exercise 
of the offi   cial authority count as legal bases. 
‘Public interest’ should not be taken to mean, ‘it would be generally 
good for the public if this processing happened’, but rather that there is 
a defined public interest that can be identified. 
EXAMPLES
A bus company provides public transportation in a town. The 
employees of the company acting as ticket inspectors can demand 
the contact details of the travellers lacking tickets, in order to issue 
fines. The legal basis is the exercise of offi   cial authority.
2. Personal data protection basics
59A company provides energy in a town. When the information 
concerning the household consumptions and usages are processed, 
the legal basis may be the public interest.
Legitimate interests pursued by the data controller
In certain cases, the processing of personal data is necessary for the 
purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by controllers or third 
parties, insofar as they are not overridden by the interests or the 
fundamental rights of the data subjects.
The elements that SMEs must consider when using this legal basis are:
»whether they have a  legitimate interest for the processing. 
For this, an SME has to consider if an interest is: 
»lawful , meaning in accordance with applicable EU and national laws; 
»suffi   ciently specific , to allow the balancing test with the interests 
and fundamental rights of the data subject to be carried out; 
»real and present , in the sense of not speculative.100
»whether the processing is necessary for that purpose.
»whether the legitimate interest is not overridden by the data 
subjects’ interests, rights or freedoms.101

the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC’ (9 April 2014)

2. Personal data protection basics
60As a general criterion, the legitimate interest can be invoked as a legal 
basis when the data subject can reasonably expect, at the time and in 
the context of the collection of the personal data, that processing for 
that purpose may take place.102 When the processing of personal data is 
strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud, this constitutes 
a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.103
EXAMPLES
A restaurant off  ers food delivery services. New clients may enjoy a 
free meal delivered to their home. The off  er can be activated upon 
subscription, yet it is limited to one time per household. In this case, 
the company may check its database of existing clients to confirm 
that a new client is not from a household that has already benefited 
from this off  er. 
An online shop requires its customers to share their email addresses 
in order to send them updates about the execution of their orders. 
For this processing, the shop relies on consent. If the shop decides 
to use email addresses to send marketing materials, this entails a 
change in purpose of the processing. Consequently, the shop needs 
to have a legitimate basis for this new type of processing. The shop, 
provided that the above criteria are met, may invoke the legal basis 
of a legitimate interest.

61RELEVANT DPA DECISION 
Even if the GDPR provides that the processing of personal data for 
direct marketing purposes may be regarded as being carried out for a 
legitimate interest,104this is not always the case. 
For example, the Dutch DPA imposed a fine upon a tennis association 
for sharing its members’ data with some sponsors, who used this 
for marketing purposes. In this case, the Dutch DPA denied that the 
mere commercial interest could constitute a legitimate interest.105
However, the decision remains highly controversial.

2.5.     What are the data subjects’ rights?
2.5.1. Background 
Under the GDPR, data subjects have a set of rights relating to their 
personal data. In practice, these rights place obligations upon data 
controllers.106 SMEs acting as data controllers have a responsibility 
to respond to queries from data subjects about the exercise of their 
rights. SMEs acting as processors may also play a part in this; they are 
likely to be requested to assist the controllers through the provision 
of appropriate technical and organizational measures to grant data 
subjects their rights when this is possible.107
SUGGESTION
The written agreement between the controller and the processor 
may clarify how the processor will practically assist the controller in 
complying with data subjects’ requests.

 10 JIPITEC 283 https://ssrn.com/abstract=3544173 . 
107 Article 28(3)(e) GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
63In principle, the data controller must reply to data subject queries 
‘without undue delay’, and within a month .108 This time limit can be 
extended where necessary, providing that the data subject is warned 
within 30 days and the delay is ‘duly motivated’ (e.g. due to the 
complexity of the issues, the number of the requests). Data subjects can 
present the request verbally (e.g. telephone) or in writing (e.g. email, 
post, social media).109
Not all requests from data subjects are justified. When data subjects’ 
requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (e.g. repetitive), the 
controller may either charge a reasonable fee on the basis of the real 
administrative costs that would arise from meeting the request (it is 
not possible to charge a penalty amount) or refuse to act. Still, the 
controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded 
or excessive character of the request.
Before following up on a request, the data controller should verify the 
identity of the person presenting it. This should be done in order to 
prevent third parties from gaining unlawful access to the personal data 
of others.
In some cases, requests concerning the exercise of data subjects’ rights 
may come from third parties and not from the data subject directly (e.g. 
if a solicitor or a family member acts on behalf of the data subject upon 
their request and consent, if a data subject lacks the mental or legal 
capacity to manage their own aff  airs).110

64SUGGESTIONS
If a Data Protection Offi   cer (DPO) is appointed, she is responsible for 
the following activities:
»addressing data subjects’ requests;
» having a policy to deal with data access requests (specifying roles, 
internal deadlines, etc.), which increases effi   ciency in dealing with 
such requests; and 
»keeping written records of the (verbal) requests received and of the 
follow-ups to these helps a company to demonstrate compliance 
with the GDPR in the event of an investigation by a DPA.

2.5.2. What are data subjects’ requests, and how can   
 these be fulfilled? 
Right to transparency and information
Data subjects must be informed, in clear and plain language , about:
»the main elements of processing operations (i.e. type of personal 
data processed, legal basis, specification of the purposes, data 
retention period, eventual data transfers, etc.); 
»contact details of parties involved (e.g. data controllers and, if 
present, DPO and recipients); and
»the existence of their data subjects’ rights, and how to exercise/
claim these.
2. Personal data protection basics
65SUGGESTION
Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR contain a detailed list of information 
to be provided to data subjects in diff  erent processing situations. SMEs’ 
privacy and data protection notices should meet these requirements. 
A clear and transparent privacy/data protection notice increases the 
trust of data subjects, and it may most likely reduce the number of 
queries submitted by data subjects.
A privacy/data protection notice must be concise, transparent, 
intelligible and easily accessible.
SUGGESTION
There are several techniques that can be used by SMEs to provide 
information:
»a layered approach;
»dashboards;
»just-in-time notices;
»icons; 
»mobile and smart device functionalities;111 and
»cartoons, infographics or flowcharts .112

Right to access
The right to access (Article 15 of the GDPR) gives a data subject the right 
to be told by the controller if their personal data has been processed 
and, if so, to obtain access to and a copy of the personal data processed. 
Data access requests may come from either data subjects who are external 
to the organization (e.g. clients) or who are internal (e.g. employees).
The idea behind the right to access is that data subjects can check the 
lawfulness of data practices of a data controller. 
While the right to information under Articles 13 and 14 is meant to 
ensure that the data subject receives a general and comprehensive 
picture of the processing, the right to access under Article 15 seeks to 
ensure that the data subject receives information on the processing of 
their personal data in order to control the lawfulness of processing.
When replying to a data access request, the data controller should 
provide the data subject with the following information:113
113 Article 15 GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
67»they should confirm the identity of the individual requesting 
the data to decide whether personal data concerning the data 
subject(s) is being processed;
»they should provide a copy of the personal data undergoing 
processing (in so far as this does not aff  ect the rights and freedoms 
of others); and
provide information as to: 
»the purposes of the processing; 
»the categories of personal data concerned (e.g. contact details, 
credit card details);
»the (categories of) recipients (who else the data is being provided to);
»the retention period, meaning for how long personal data will be 
stored, or the criteria by which this is determined;
»the existence of the right to request from the controller rectifica-
tion, erasure, restriction of processing, object to the processing of 
personal data concerning the data subject;
»the existence of the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory 
authority;
»the source of personal data, where it is not collected directly from 
the data subject;
»the existence of any automated decision-making, including 
profiling, together with meaningful information about how 
that decision-making works (‘the logic involved’), as well as the 
significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing 
for the data subject; and
»the appropriate safeguards existing in case of a data transfer to 
third countries or international organizations (e.g. standard data 
protection clauses, binding corporate rules, a code of conduct, a 
certification).
2. Personal data protection basics
68EXAMPLE
A data access request may concern a registry containing the personal 
data of the person advancing the request, but it may also concern 
personal data of others. In this case, the data controller needs 
to balance the right to access of the data subjects with the rights 
of the other people that may be aff  ected by the disclosure of the 
information. The data controller cannot simply refuse to provide all 
relevant information, but endeavours should be made to comply 
with the request to as great an extent as possible. When complying 
with this obligation, the controller must ensure adequate protection 
for the rights and freedoms of others.114 For example, access to the 
registry may be provided only after deleting the personal data of the 
other people concerned.
In providing a copy of an image containing the data subject and other 
people, the data controller might blur out the images of the other 
people before supplying that image to the requester. 
SUGGESTION
When the data access request is broad, the controller may ask the 
concerned individual to clarify its scope. This could reduce the time 
and eff  ort the controller needs to spend on compiling relevant data 
and preparing a response to the request.
 Consider whether software tracking tools could be used in order to 
assist and to optimize costs associated with data subjects’ requests.

Right to rectification
Data subjects have the right to demand the data controller correct 
(‘rectify’) the information concerning them. The right to rectification 
is useful both for the data subjects and for SMEs because this right 
facilitates the keeping of data that is up-to-date. 
If the controller has disclosed the personal data being corrected to 
any other recipients, then they should communicate any rectification 
to each recipient, unless this proves to be impossible or involves a 
disproportionate eff  ort.115
Right to erasure, a.k.a. right to be forgotten (right to de-listing)
Data subjects have the right to have their personal data deleted from 
the records of the data controller. 
The controller deletes the personal data when: 
»it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was processed; 
»it was collected in relation to the off  er of information society 
services to children;
»it was unlawfully processed (e.g. without a legal basis);
115 Article 19 GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
70»the data subject withdraws consent or objects to the processing, 
and there is no other legal ground for the processing; and/or
»Union or Member State law requires the controller to do so.116
There are numerous exceptions to the right to erasure. They may include 
the exercise of the right of freedom of expression and information, the 
need to comply with a Union or national legal obligation requiring the 
processing, and the exercise or defense of legal claims.
If the controller has disclosed the personal data being corrected to any 
other recipients, then they should communicate any erasure request 
to each recipient, unless this proves to be impossible or involves a 
disproportionate eff  ort.117
EXAMPLE
When complying with the right to erasure, all personal data in backup
copies (with either the controller or the processor, as well as third 
parties) shall be erased. Furthermore, the ability to restore erased 
data shall be finally terminated by all technically feasible means.
SUGGESTION
In practice, to facilitate the exercise of the data subject’s rights, a 
controller could put a form for the requesting of erasure on their 
website.

Right to restriction of processing 
The data subject can ask the data controller to temporarily limit the 
processing of their personal data when one of the following applies: 
»the accuracy of the personal data is contested; 
»the processing is unlawful and the data subject requests restriction 
instead of erasure;
»the controller no longer needs the data for the purposes of 
processing (so it would otherwise be deleted), but the data must 
be kept for the exercise or defence of legal claims; and
»a decision is pending on the legitimate interests of the data 
controller prevailing over the interests of the data subject.
The controller shall communicate any restriction to each recipient 
to whom they disclosed the personal data unless this proves to be 
impossible or involves a disproportionate eff  ort.118 Furthermore, 
the controller must notify the data subject before the restriction on 
processing is lifted.119
118 Article 19 GDPR.
119 Footnote 30, 223.
2. Personal data protection basics
72EXAMPLES
Methods to grant the restriction of processing include: 
»temporarily moving the selected data to another processing system;
»making the data unavailable to users;
»removing personal data temporarily; and
»clearly marking the data as restricted.
Right to data portability
The idea behind the right to data portability is that data subjects should 
be able to easily take their personal data with them between services. 
Under the GDPR, data subjects enjoy the right to data portability in 
situations where the personal data that they have provided to a controller 
is processed by automated means on the basis of consent, or where the 
personal data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract 
and is carried out by automated means. This means that the right to 
data portability does not apply in situations where the personal data 
processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or a contract.120
At a practical level, data subjects are entitled to have their personal data 
transmitted directly from one controller to another, if this is technically 
feasible. To facilitate this, the controller should use interoperable data 
formats that enable data portability for the data subject. Formats have 
to be machine-readable, structured, and commonly used. The GDPR 
does not provide recommendations on the specific format to be used to 
achieve data portability.
The right to data portability does not create an obligation for a data 
controller to adopt or maintain processing systems that are technically 
compatible with those of other organizations.
120 Article 20 GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
73Implementing data portability solutions can benefit SMEs in 
circumstances where such solutions would facilitate switches between 
service providers.
EXAMPLE
Structured, commonly used and machine-readable formats appropriate
for data portability include CSV, XML, JSON or RDF.121
Right to object 
The data subject has the right to object when the processing is carried 
out by the data controller: 
»on the basis of public interest or legitimate interest; 
»for direct marketing purposes; 
»in the context of information society services; and
»for scientific, historical or statistical purposes.122
When a data subject objects to processing in these circumstances, the 
data controller has to stop processing the respective personal data, 
unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the 
processing that override the rights of the data subject. 
The controller can automate the exercising of the right to object.
EXAMPLE
Blocking cookies on a webpage is a way to object to the processing.

122 Article 21 GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
74Right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated 
decision-making (or profiling) 
Automated decision-making is the ability to make decisions by 
technological means without human involvement. Automated decisions 
can be based on any type of data. Examples of such data includes data 
provided directly by the individuals concerned (such as responses to a 
questionnaire); data observed about the individuals (such as location 
data collected via an application); derived or inferred data (such as a 
profile of the individual that has already been created, e.g. a credit 
score).123
Profiling is any form of automated processing of personal data 
consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal 
aspects relating to a natural person, in particular, to analyse or predict 
aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic 
situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, 
location or movements. 
If such decisions have legal eff  ects or produce significant eff  ects, and 
therefore have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, the data 
subject has the right to not be subjected solely to these automated 
decisions.
EXAMPLES
A company relies on an automated system to calculate the annual 
bonus to be paid to its employees. The payment of a bonus produces 
significant eff  ects on a person; it determines the amount of the annual 
bonus. Therefore, the final decision on the bonus must be scrutinized 
by a human.

Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679’ (22 August 2018)

2.6. The obligation to appoint a Data 
Protection Offi   cer (DPO)
2.6.1. Background
With the adoption of the GDPR, both controllers and processors may be 
required to appoint a Data Protection Offi   cer (DPO). The concept of a 
DPO is not a new one, and the WP29 previously argued that the DPO is 
a cornerstone of accountability.
2.6.2. Is the appointment of a DPO mandatory for SMEs?
In practice, the requirement to appoint a DPO will not typically apply to 
SMEs. At the same time, it should be noted that, contrary to a popular 
belief, it is not the size of a company that determines whether it has a legal 
obligation to appoint a DPO, but rather it is determined by the core data 
processing activities the organization conducts. These are the personal 
data processing activities essential to achieving the company’s goals. The 
appointment of a DPO therefore concerns SMEs acting as  either controllers 
2. Personal data protection basics
76or processors. They may decide to opt for an internal (appointing a 
member of staff  ) or external (hiring in a DPO as a service) DPO. 
The main role of a DPO is that of ensuring that the organization processes 
the personal data of its staff  , customers, providers, or any other person 
in compliance with the applicable data protection rules.124
Having a DPO is mandatory in certain cases, where: 
1. the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for 
courts acting in their judicial capacity.
This requirement may be applicable to SMEs that fall within the scope of 
the definition of public authorities. They include legal persons governed 
by public law or by private law, which are entrusted, under the legal 
regime applicable to them, with the performance of services of public 
interest and which are, for this purpose, vested with special powers 
beyond those which result from the normal rules applicable in relations 
between persons governed by private law.125
EXAMPLE
If an SME provides services of a public nature, such as transport 
services, water and energy supply, road infrastructure, broadcasting, 
public housing, etc., then it may be considered to be a public authority. 
Determining if an SME is a public authority is important, as this may 
necessitate the appointment of a DPO.
2. the core activities of the SME consist of processing operations which, 
by their nature, their scope, and/or their purpose(s), require regular 
and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale. 
124 EDPS, ‘Data Protection Offi   cer’ https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/
data-protection/reference-library/data-protection-offi   cer-dpo_en . 
125 See, for example, CJEU, Case C- 279/ 12, Fish Legal and Shirley, para. 42 and case 
law cited therein http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&num=C-279/12 .  
2. Personal data protection basics
77Core activities refer to the main business pursued by an SME. It may 
be that the core activity of the SME is inextricably linked with data 
processing (e.g. if the SME is an App developer). At the same time, 
certain data processing activities, while possibly being essential or 
necessary to a business, are considered ancillary (e.g. paying employees 
or having standard IT support activities).
Monitoring entails tracking individuals’ usage of the internet.126 The 
monitoring is regular and systematic  when it is ongoing, or occurring 
at particular intervals of time, and is pre-arranged, organized, or 
methodical, taking place as part of a general plan for data collection or 
strategy.
Activities that may constitute regular and systematic monitoring of data 
subjects include: operating a telecommunications network; providing 
telecommunications services; email retargeting; data-driven marketing 
activities; profiling and scoring for purposes of risk assessment (e.g. 
for purposes of credit scoring, establishment of insurance premiums, 
fraud prevention, detection of money laundering); location tracking, 
for example, by mobile apps; loyalty programs; behavioural advertising; 
webscraping; monitoring of wellness, fitness and health data via 
wearable devices.
The factors determining whether the processing is carried out on a large 
scale  are the number of data subjects concerned (either as a specific 
number or as a proportion of the relevant population); the volume of data 
and/or the range of diff  erent data items being processed; the duration, 
or permanence, of the data processing activity; the geographical extent 
of the processing activity.
126 Recital 24 GDPR.
2. Personal data protection basics
78EXAMPLES
Large-scale activities encompass the processing of travel data of 
individuals using a city’s public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel 
cards), and the processing of real-time geo-location data for statistical 
purposes by a processor specialized in providing these services.
A medium-sized tile manufacturing company subcontracts its 
occupational health services to an external processor, which has a 
large number of clients. The processor needs to designate a DPO 
because the processing is on a large scale. However, the manufacturer 
itself is not necessarily under an obligation to designate a DPO.127
3. the core activities of the SME consist of processing on a large scale 
of special categories of data or personal data relating to criminal 
convictions and off  ences.
Special categories of data are those listed in Article 9 of the GDPR. 
They include data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, 
religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic 
data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural 
person, data concerning health, and data concerning a natural person’s 
sex life or sexual orientation.
EXAMPLES
»A medical laboratory that performs blood tests must appoint a DPO. 
»A law firm focusing on criminal trials or a health clinic – but not an 
individual lawyer or a health care professional – must appoint a DPO.128

128 Personal data should not be considered to be processed on a large scale if the 
processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual 
physician, other health care professional or lawyers (Recital 91 GDPR).
2. Personal data protection basics
79»An SME running a dating app, which collects a barrage of sensitive 
data about its users, is required to have a DPO.
2.6.3. Who should be a DPO?
A DPO may either be an employee of the SME or an  external expert . It 
is fundamental that a DPO is independent , and the following is ensured:
»the DPO shall be provided with all the necessary resources to carry 
out their tasks, in terms of money, time, workforce, time to devote 
to professional development, etc.; 
»the DPO shall not receive instructions for the undertaking of their tasks;
»the DPO shall not be dismissed or penalized for the performance 
of their tasks;
»the DPO shall report to the highest level of management; and
»the DPO should not have any conflicts of interest in respect to 
other tasks and duties (e.g. determining objects and purposes of 
the processing, representing the SME in legal proceedings).
To ensure the independence of the function, at a practical level, an 
employee acting as a DPO must have no doubts regarding their role. 
SUGGESTION
Within SMEs, individuals often perform multiple roles. A DPO role 
cannot be assigned to individuals acting as:
»chief executive offi   cer;
»chief operating offi   cer;
»chief financial offi   cer;
»chief medical offi   cer;
»head of marketing department;
»head of Human Resources; and
»head of IT department.
2. Personal data protection basics
80The level of expertise of a DPO needs to match the sensitivity, complexity 
and amount of data that an organization processes. For example, where 
a data processing activity is particularly complex, or where a large 
amount of sensitive data is involved, a DPO may need a higher level of 
expertise and experience. 
The GDPR neither imposes an obligation for certification of a DPO, nor 
does it encourage such certification voluntarily. 
2.6.4. What tasks can be assigned to a DPO working for 
an SME?
The GDPR lists the following tasks that can be assigned to a DPO: 
»informing and advising  the SME on the obligations arising from the 
GDPR and other EU or national data protection provisions.
»monitoring compliance of the SME with the GDPR, other national 
and EU data protection provisions, and with the SME’s own policies 
regarding the protection of personal data. The latter may concern 
assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of 
staff   involved in personal data processing operations and auditing. 
 Awareness raising and training can potentially reduce compliance 
costs (e.g. trained employees can handle personal data responsibly 
and take appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access). 
EXAMPLE
The DPO can collect information to identify processing activities; 
analyse and check the compliance of processing activities; inform, 
advise and issue recommendations to the controller or the processor.129
129 Footnote 128, 24.
2. Personal data protection basics
81The DPO themselves cannot be considered personally responsible 
for the controller or processor’s non-compliance with data protection 
requirements.130
»providing advice  where requested as part of data protection impact 
assessments (DPIA) and monitoring  the performance of a DPIA;
EXAMPLE
An SME can ask a DPO to advise:
»if they should carry out the DPIA process; 
»the method they should use to do it; 
»whether to outsource the DPIA process or not; 
»the risk mitigation measures they need to apply; 
»whether the DPIA has been correctly carried out and if its conclusions 
(whether or not to go ahead with the processing and what safeguards 
to apply) comply with data protection requirements.131
The DPO cannot perform the DPIA themselves, as this task would be 
incompatible with the independence requirement. The DPO entrusted 
with the undertaking of the DPIA would combine the functions of an 
assessor and an auditor of the DPIA process. Nevertheless, the DPO can 
play a fundamental role in assisting the controller.
»cooperating with the supervisory authority (i.e. a DPA);
»acting as the contact point for the supervisory authority  on issues 
relating to processing and consulting, where appropriate, with 
regard to any other matter;
130 Ibid.
131 Idem, 25.
2. Personal data protection basics
82EXAMPLE
When notifying a DPA of a data breach, the controller is required to 
provide the name and contact details of its DPO as a contact point. 
However, the DPO cannot represent its SME in a court in case of 
proceedings about data protection compliance, as this would be 
incompatible with the independence required from this function.132
»handling data subjects’ requests and complaints ; and
»fulfilling other tasks and duties , providing that they do not result 
in a conflict of interests.
EXAMPLES
A DPO can be tasked with creating and maintaining a register of the 
processing activities, under the responsibility of the controller or the 
processor. Such records should be considered as one of the tools 
enabling the DPO to perform their tasks of monitoring compliance 
and informing and advising the controller or the processor.133
A DPO can provide advice on the data-sharing agreements to be

832.6.5. Can an SME share a DPO with other organizations?
Yes, appointing a joint DPO may be a practical solution for a group 
of SMEs. The GDPR allows for this, providing that the DPO is easily 
accessible from each establishment. 
The notion of accessibility refers to the tasks of the DPO as a contact 
point with respect to data subjects, the supervisory authority, and, also, 
internally within the organization. 
2.6.6. What should be considered before appointing a 
DPO?
»Even if not all SMEs have to appoint a DPO, it may be useful to have 
an expert in data protection working within the enterprise. 
»When the SME is entrusted with the performance of services of 
public interest, even if it is not mandatory, it is recommended that 
the SME designates a DPO.135
»The level of expertise needed by a DPO depends on the risks arising 
from the processing operations.
SUGGESTIONS
Keeping written documentation explaining why an enterprise chose 
(not) to appoint a DPO, and why their level of expertise was deemed 
appropriate, may help an SME to demonstrate compliance in the event 
of an investigation by a DPA. 
Similarly, when an SME decides to pursue an activity against the advice 
of the DPO, it should document the reasoning behind its decision. 
Maintaining such a record can demonstrate compliance with the GDPR 
in the event of an investigation by a DPA.

RELEVANT DPA DECISIONS 
A German SME active in the telecommunications sector was fined by 
the Federal DPA because it did not comply with the legal requirement 
under Article 37 of the GDPR of appointing a data protection offi   cer 
despite repeated requests to do so. The fine of EUR 10,000 was 
deemed to be proportionate, taking into account that the company is 
a micro-enterprise.137

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
853. The theory and 
practice of a risk-based 
approach
3.1. Background
A risk-based approach to personal data protection builds upon the idea 
that respecting data protection principles is not in itself suffi   cient to 
protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.138 There are 
many, many ways in which personal data might be processed, and the 
reality of data processing can be complex. For this reason, compliance 
with the data protection principles needs to be supplemented with risk 
analysis and the management of risks.139 In other words, the risk-based 
approach aims to give data protection principles more substance and to 
tailor them to specific and evolving data processing situations.140
While there is uncertainty surrounding the meaning of risk within 
the GDPR, following the risk-based approach, data controllers and 
processors are required to assess and act upon risks to individuals 
arising from personal data processing activities .This may include a 
series of coordinated activities to evaluate, control and mitigate risks.141
138 Principles related to the processing of personal data are listed in Article 5 of the 
GDPR and encompass: lawfulness; fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; 
data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
86The four basic steps of risk management are: 
1. identification 
2. analysis
3. evaluation 
4. treatment.142
3.2. What is a risk in the GDPR?
The understanding of ‘risk’ in law – and specifically in European data 
protection law – is still evolving.143 To date, talking about or working with 
‘risk’ was more common in the areas of finance, technology, economics 
and natural sciences. In general, risk evaluation can be ‘subjective’144
and ‘objective’,145 as well as voluntarily undertaken,146 societally 
imposed,147 discrete and pervasive.148 Any risk can be evaluated from 
diff  erent perspectives (e.g. technological, economics, psychological).149
The perception of risk is variable, being aff  ected by diff  erent attitudes, 
how information is given and portrayed, and the familiarity of the 
person with an activity or hazard.150 Other elements that can play a 
role are the degree to which an individual feels in control, whether an 
individual is exposed to an activity voluntarily, or the perceived benefits 
of an activity.151

143 Beck, U., World at Risk  (Polity 2009) 6.
144 Subjective risk assessment entails non-expert perceptions by the public.
145 Objective risk is assessed scientifically by experts and is probabilistic. 
146 For example, by taking some medication, such as contraception. 
147 For example, a nuclear power plant. 
148 The latter includes risks that are bound to happen, such as an earthquake.

151 Ibid.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
87The GDPR does not contain a definition of `risk’ but the WP29 suggests 
that ‘ a ‘risk’ is a scenario describing an event and its consequences, 
estimated in terms of severity and likelihood’.152
More specifically, in data protection law, risks relate to threats to 
the rights and freedoms of individuals whose personal data is being 
processed (i.e. data subjects) or natural persons in more general terms. 
Such threats are not limited to the right to protection of personal data 
or privacy, but involve other fundamental rights, such as freedom 
of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of movement, prohibition 
of discrimination, right to liberty, conscience, and religion.153 This 
understanding of risk is quite diff  erent to other forms of business risk, 
where the risk is assessed with reference to the firm.
EXAMPLE
Keeping the medical records of a patient accurate and up to date is 
not just a matter of data accuracy. Inaccurate or outdated information 
in a medical record can prejudice the health or the life of the patient, 
creating a risk to their rights and freedoms.
3.3. What does cause risks?
Risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons may result from 
personal data processing activities that could lead to physical, material, 
or non-material damage to an individual.154
152 Footnote 141, Ibid.
153 Ibid.
154 Recital 75 GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
88EXAMPLES
Personal data processing activities can cause risks where:
»the processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or 
fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality 
of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorized 
reversal of pseudonymization, or any other significant economic or 
social disadvantage; 
»data subjects might be deprived of their rights and freedoms, or 
prevented from exercising control over their personal data; 
»personal data is processed in a way that reveals racial or ethnic 
origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade 
union membership, and the processing of genetic data, data 
concerning health or data concerning sex life or criminal convictions 
and off  ences or related security measures; 
»personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting 
aspects concerning performance at work, economic situation, 
health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, 
location or movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; 
»personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in particular of children, 
are processed; or 
»processing involves a large amount of personal data and aff  ects a 
large number of data subjects.155
155 Recital 75 GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
89SUGGESTIONS
To identify risks, an SME may, for example: 
»seek advice from its DPO, if it has appointed one;
»consult knowledge bases;156and/or
»perform interviews and brainstorming with relevant stakeholders.157
3.4. How can risks under the GDPR be 
evaluated? 
Under the GDPR, diff  erent risk levels trigger the application of legal 
requirements. The Regulation distinguishes at least three types of risk 
situations aff  ecting the rights and freedoms of individuals deriving from 
the processing operations:
1. low-risk situations; 
2. risky situations; and 
3. high-risk situations. 
One company can have multiple processing operations of personal data 
in place, and they may each have diff  erent risk levels associated with 
them.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
90EXAMPLES
As a general rule, from a data protection perspective, certain business 
sectors are presumed to be riskier than others, for example: health care 
services; solvency and creditworthiness; creation and use of profiles 
(profiling); political, trade union and religious activities; telecommuni-
cations services; insurances; banking and financial companies; social 
services activities; advertising; large-scale CCTV (Closed Circuit TV or 
video surveillance of major infrastructures such as railway stations or 
shopping centres). 
Similarly, the processing of certain types of data entails high risks, 
for example: personal data revealing ethnic or racial origin; political 
opinions or religious beliefs data; trade union membership data; 
genetic data; biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying 
a natural person; data concerning physical or mental health; data 
concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation; personal 
data relating to criminal convictions and off  ences; geolocation data. 
Also, certain types of processing operations entail risks, for example: 
creating or analysing profiles; large-scale advertising and trade 
promotion to potential clients; provision of services for the operation 
of public networks or electronic communications services (Internet 
Service Providers, ISPs); management of associates or members of 
political parties, trade unions, churches, religious confessions or 
communities, charities and other non-profit organizations with a 
political, philosophical, religious or trade union purpose; management, 
sanitary control or supply of medicines; health or sanitary history).158
Other sectors and activities might still be high-risk, but these areas 
have historically had a tendency to raise risks and cause problems for 
people so are considered to be high-risk by default.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
91Typically, the risk level is assessed by combing the likelihood or 
probability (of the risk to materialize) and the severity (of the 
consequences due to the materialization of the risk).159 The GDPR 
specifies that likelihood and severity are to be determined considering: 
nature (i.e. inherent characteristics or type), scope (scale and range), 
context (i.e. circumstances), and purposes (i.e. aims) of the processing 
operations.160
Risk can be assessed qualitatively or quantitatively, or by combining the 
two. Quantitative risk assessment requires very precise values, namely 
the definition of the probability of each single risk factor’s occurrence 
(expressed in a scale 0-1), and the quantitative definition of its severity. 
Qualitative risk assessment, in turn, assumes the impossibility of 
attaining such precise values, and expresses likelihood and severity in 
scales. In most cases, the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural 
persons are suited to qualitative evaluation.161

For qualitative risk assessment, an exemplary severity scale of 1-5 
could be:162
Value Severity of impact on rights and freedom of data subjects
S1 Low - Mere inconvenience/Annoyance
S2 Moderate - Minor physical, material or non-material damage 
to rights and freedoms of data subjects (e.g. stress, feeling 
of loss of control of personal data, minor economic loss, etc.)
S3 Medium - Physical, material or non-material damage to rights 
and freedoms of data subjects (e.g. restrictions to exercising 
rights) 
S4 High - Significant physical, material or non-material damage 
to rights and freedoms of data subjects that can only be 
overcome by data subjects with diffi   culty
S5 Critical - Irreversible physical, material or non-material 
damage to rights and freedoms of data subjects
Whereas a likelihood scale 1-5 could be:163
Value Likelihood of occurrence
L1 Remote - it does not seem possible that the selected risk 
sources will materialize
L2 Unlikely - it seems unlikely that the selected risk sources will 
materialize
L3 Occasional - it seems possible that the selected risk sources 
will materialize
L4 Likely - it seems highly possible that the selected risk sources 
will materialize
L5 Frequent - it is almost certain that the selected risk sources 
will materialize

93The corresponding risk matrix could be: 
L5 510 15 20 25 Risk level or magnitude
(obtained by multiplying 
likelihood and severity)

These scales and risk matrix are only to be seen as indicative.
Controllers may establish diff  erent scales (e.g. 1-3, 1-4). In the risk 
matrix, they can identify diff  erent values for low risk, moderate risk, 
etc. (e.g. low risk ≤ 1, critical risk ≥ 25).

94SUGGESTION
Keep a registry of risks related to the processing operations presents 
several advantages. First, going through the process of completing 
it raises awareness in an organization as to potential data protection 
issues associated with a project, and allows identification and 
mitigation of data protection risks. It also supports the choice of the 
most appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure 
data security and data protection by design. Second, it can facilitate 
the performance of a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) when 
required, and may help an organization to demonstrate compliance 
with the law in the event of a regulatory investigation or audit.166

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
953.5. What are the provisions embedding a 
risk-based approach in the GDPR? 
The risk-based approach is embedded in the following GDPR provisions: 
»Article 24 on the responsibility of the controller (which is related 
to the principle of accountability);
»Article 25 on data protection by design and by default; 
»Article 30 on the obligation for documentation (records of 
processing activities); 
»Article 32 on the security of processing; 
»Articles 33 and 34 on personal data breach notifications; 
»Article 35 on the obligation to carry out an impact assessment 
(DPIA); and
»Article 36 on prior consultation. 
While the formulation of the risk-based approach varies to some 
degree in the above-listed articles, in essence, it aims to ensure that, 
whatever the level of risk involved in the processing of personal data, 
data protection principles and data subjects’ rights are respected.  In 
practice, this means that the data controllers and processors need to 
adjust the data protection obligations to the risks presented by a data 
processing activity.167
Typically, the risk-based approach is conceptualized in the GDPR 
through the following elements: 
»current standards (in terms of technical and organizational 
measures) for the means of processing;
»the cost of implementation;
»the nature, scope, context of the processing;
»purposes of the processing; and
»risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of 
natural persons posed by the processing.168
167 Kuner, C., Bygrave, L. and Docksey, C., /T_h.liga  e EU General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR): A Commentary  (OUP 2020) 26.
168 Footnote 160, 9.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
96The risk and the assessment criteria are the same: the assets to 
protect are always the same (the individuals, via the protection of 
their personal data), against the same risks (to individuals’ rights and 
freedoms), taking into account the same conditions (nature, scope, 
context and purposes of processing).169
3.6. How can a risk-based approach benefit 
SMEs?
Risks for data subjects do not depend on the size of the controllers, but on 
the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of the processing operations. 
Considering compliance with the GDPR through the lens of a risk-based 
approach is particularly useful for SMEs for the following reasons: 
»SMEs enjoy certain freedom in determining the techniques to be 
used to perform the risk analysis and to evaluate the level of risk of 
the processing operations. Likewise, SMEs are free to choose the 
measures to mitigate such (high) risks; 
»It allows flexibility when adhering to data protection requirements. 
It does not prescribe or demand a particular measure to comply 
with the law. Instead, it requires that the SME understands the data 
processing operation by considering its nature, scope, context, and 
purposes, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for 
the rights and freedoms of natural persons whose personal data 
is being processed. In practice, this means that the GDPR grants 
SMEs enough margin to customize technical and organizational 
solutions to their specific needs.170
169 Ibid.
170 Footnote 14.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
97»It allows to overcome, to a certain extent, the one-size-fits-all 
approach. The measures to be adopted by an SME that only 
performs low-risk data processing can be far more limited than 
those to be adopted by an SME whose business activities are based 
on high-risk data processing operations in order to comply with the 
GDPR. 
Although the risk-based approach is easy to identify in the text of the 
GDPR, it can still be tricky to apply in practice. As suggested by the 
European regulators, the risk-based approach may include the use 
of baselines, best practices, and standards. These might provide a 
useful toolbox for controllers to tackle similar risks in similar situations 
(situations determined by the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of 
the processing). It is therefore worth understanding what practices and 
solutions already exist in your industry or field. 
3.7. A risk-based approach in practice
3.7.1.  Responsibility of the controller and the principle 
of accountability
Background
The accountability principle establishes that ‘the controller shall be 
responsible for, and be able to, demonstrate compliance with’ the other 
principles relating to the processing of personal data and the GDPR. 
Processors are also expected to be accountable, as they have to comply 
with obligations related to accountability and assist the data controller 
in a number of their compliance requirements.171 Hence, the principle 
is relevant for any SME, regardless of their role in the processing 
operations. 
171 For example, processors have to keep a record of the processing activities (Article 
30(2) GDPR); appoint a DPO in certain situations (Article 37 GDPR); implement 
technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing (Article 
32 GDPR). See FRA/ECtHR/EDPS, Handbook on European data protection law 
(Publications Offi   ce of the European Union 2018) 135, 136. 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
98In the field of data protection and privacy, accountability is considered 
to be a form of enhanced responsibility172 or a proactive demonstration 
of an organization’s capacity to comply with the GDPR.173 Accountability 
can boost transparency and confidence for both data subjects and 
regulators, and ensure greater transparency of business practices.174
The actual recognition of the principle of accountability within the GDPR 
marks a shift from a primarily reactive approach to proactive compliance 
and practice.175 Whereas (mere) compliance entails that an SME meets 
certain rules, the accountability principle goes further: SMEs have to 
actively demonstrate their commitment to protecting personal data.176
For example, a risk assessment, or the evaluation of the ‘appropriateness’ 
of technical and organizational measures, cannot be reduced to mere 
‘box-ticking’ exercises.177
What does an SME need to do to be accountable? 
An SME acting as a data controller is responsible for implementing 
appropriate technical and organizational measures, including data 
protection policies, to ensure and demonstrate that its processing 
activities are compliant with the requirements of the GDPR.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
99When taking such measures, the controller has to consider the nature, 
scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks to 
the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and 
severity.178
Even an SME acting as a processor has to provide suffi   cient guarantees 
of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures in a 
way that facilitates the processing’s meeting of the requirements of the 
GDPR and ensuring of the protection of the rights of data subjects.179
SUGGESTION
Keeping written documentation about the technical and organizational 
measures in place that explains why the measures were chosen is an 
eff  ective way to demonstrate compliance with the law.
What are the other examples of accountability measures? 
A (non-exhaustive) list of accountability measures includes:
»adopting and implementing data protection policies at the organi-
zational level of an SME; 
»implementing the principles of data protection by design and 
default (Article 25), 
»concluding written agreements between (joint) controllers, 
controllers and processors, and processors and sub-processors, 
specifying reciprocal roles and responsibilities; 
»maintaining documentation of the processing activities (Article 30);
»implementing appropriate security measures (Article 32); 
»maintaining a procedure to respond to requests for access to 
personal data;
»publishing privacy notices online;

»recording and, where necessary, reporting personal data breaches 
to DPAs and data subjects;180
»carrying out data a protection impact assessment (DPIA) (Article 35); 
»adhering to codes of conduct, which focus on the proper application 
of the GDPR in diff  erent processing sectors and diff  erent kinds of 
enterprises; and
»adhering to certification mechanisms, seals and marks, which promote 
diff  erent organizations’ compliance with GDPR requirements.181
These (accountability) measures need to be continuously revised and 
updated to reflect the reality of the processing operations. Hence, 
accountability requires a continuous eff  ort from controllers and 
processors.
What are the advantages of accountability for an SME?
The accountability principle focuses on taking measures that deliver 
real protection in practice. Adhering to this principle provides incentives 
for businesses to keep their data in order182 and to keep track of the data 
processing operations occurring within an organization. Furthermore, it 
may foster the implementation of innovative technical and organizational 
measures, including data protection notices, within an SME. 
Finally, accountability of a controller can increase levels of trust between 
SMEs and their clients, creating a competitive advantage. An SME can 
show how it is doing the right thing with regard to customers’ data.

3.7.2.  Data protection by design and data protection by 
default
Background 
With the entry into force of the GDPR, the principles of Data Protection 
by Design and Data Protection by Default (DPbD and DPbDf) became 
legal obligations for controllers. 
RELEVANT DPA DECISION 
The Baden-Württemberg DPA issued a fine of EUR 20,000 to an SME 
operating a chat portal for failing to take appropriate technical and 
organizational measures. The passwords of the users were stored in 
plain text and not as a hash value. This resulted in a data theft of 
333,000 users.183

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
102The underlying objective of DPbD and DPbDf obligations is to 
integrate privacy throughout the lifecycle of various technologies and 
applications that process personal data. At the same time, the practical 
implementation of DPbD and DPbDf is tremendously complex because 
of the uncertainty surrounding the meaning of these principles.184
This approach is an advantage for SMEs. They are not bound to adopt 
predefined measures to comply with DPbD and DPbDf principles, but 
can instead adopt customized solutions. 
What does data protection by design entail?
The principle of data protection by design requires the controller to 
implement both organizational and technical measures to ensure that 
the requirements of the GDPR are embedded in the processing activity, 
in an eff  ective manner, at the time of its initiation, as well as in its 
later stages (including tenders, outsourcing, development, support, 
maintenance, testing, storage, deletion, etc.). It is an expression of a 
lifecycle thinking applied to the processing activity.185 The idea here 
is to avoid the design of a practice, process, service or product that 
involves personal data, with an attempt to ‘bolt on’ data protection 
subsequently being made as an afterthought. 
When implementing data protection by design, the controller has to 
take into account:
»the nature (i.e. the inherent characteristics of the processing 
operations), the scope (scale and range (e.g. if they concern 
sensitive data) of the processing operations), the context

processing;186
»the current standards and capabilities of the existing technical and 
organizational measures, which can vary greatly; 
»their cost of implementation, including money, time and human 
resources; and
» the risks of varying likelihood and severity to the rights and freedoms 
of natural persons deriving from the processing operations. 
In particular, the controller must:
»implement appropriate technical and organizational measures and 
necessary safeguards into the processing. An example of such a 
measure (the only one mentioned in the GDPR) is pseudonymization;
»implement data protection principles187 and integrate the necessary 
safeguards into the processing to meet the requirements of the 
Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.188 Another 
example of the ‘by design’ approach is the performance of a DPIA;189
»in an eff  ective manner; and
»at the time of the determination of the means for processing, 
at the time of the processing itself, and also with a view to the 
phase following its conclusion (lifecycle thinking).
The technical or organizational measures referred to in Article 25 can 
be anything – from the use of advanced technical solutions to the basic 
training of personnel on how to handle personal data (of customers, 
colleagues, etc.) – that could be done by the DPO. Yet, some DPAs (e.g. 
the DPC) expect as a minimum the implementation of encryption as a 
technical solution, whenever possible, where personal data is stored or 
moved.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
104There is no requirement for sophisticated measures, as long as they 
are appropriate for implementing the data protection principles 
eff  ectively.190 This means unfortunately, that there are no specific 
measures that automatically ensure compliance with the GDPR. 
To comply with DPbD and DPbDf, an SME may consider implementing 
Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs).
PETs encompass a wide range of solutions, incorporating both 
traditional data security technologies (e.g. anonymization, encryption 
cryptography, for personal data both being stored or moved) and other 
tools aimed at a more general strengthening of data protection: for 
example, antitracking tools for web browsing, dashboards and other 
user interfaces for the management of consent can be considered, as 
well as tools that enable data subjects to audit the enforcement of the 
data protection policy of a controller or to customize the terms and 
conditions of privacy policies.191
 The use of PETs may create a competitive advantage for SMEs that seek 
to attract data-protection-aware clients. 
Furthermore, the development of new PETs may represent a business 
opportunity for SMEs. Even if DPbD is only a legal obligation for 
controllers, producers of the products, services, and applications for 
which the processing of personal data is a central component should 
be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection when 
developing and designing such products, services, and applications, 
190 Footnote 160, para 9.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
105in order to ensure that controllers and processors can fulfil their data 
protection obligations.192
ENISA is currently working on establishing a PET repository and a tool to 
assess the maturity of these technologies.193
How to evaluate the appropriateness and eff  ectiveness of data 
protection by design measures? 
The appropriateness of the measures is strongly related to their 
eff  ectiveness. Eff  ectiveness means that controllers must be able to 
demonstrate that the measures chosen are suitable to achieve the goals 
of DPbD, having regard to the actual processing operations. 
It is therefore not enough to implement generic measures solely to 
document DPbD compliance; each implemented measure must have an 
actual eff  ect.194 The measures should be robust and be able to be scaled 
up in accordance with any increase in risk of non-compliance with the 
data protection principles.
To demonstrate the eff  ectiveness of the measures adopted, controllers 
may opt for the use of key performance indicators to merge the business 
objectives of SMEs with the data protection ones.
EXAMPLE
To establish SMART  (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, 
Time-bound) key performance indicators (KPIs) in terms of data 
protection by design measures, it is important that an SME considers: 
»What is the desired outcome pursued with the measure (e.g. grant 
clients/data subjects more privacy and demonstrate compliance 
with the GDPR)?
192 Recital 78 GDPR.
193 ENISA, ENISA’s PET maturity assessment repository  (2019) https://www.enisa.
europa.eu/publications/enisa2019s-pets-maturity-assessment-repository .
194 Footnote 160, para 14.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
106»Why does the desired outcome matter (e.g. to have a competitive 
advantage compared to other SMEs providing similar services, or 
avoid sanctions)?
»How will the progress be measured?
KPIs may include metrics. Metrics may be quantitative, such as the 
reduction of the level of risk related to the processing operations (e.g. 
from high to medium); the reduction of complaints of data subjects 
(e.g. indicate that, after the adoption of the measure, the number of 
complaints has been reduced by X%); the reduction of response time 
when data subjects exercise their rights (e.g. indicate that, after the 
adoption of the measure, the response time has been reduced by X%); 
or qualitative, such as the evaluations of performance (performed by 
e.g. the DPO (when appointed) or an external audit company); the use 
of grading scales, or expert assessments. Alternatively, controllers 
may provide the rationale behind their assessment of the eff  ective-
ness of the chosen measures and safeguards, but they will be held 
accountable for this.
When establishing and defining KPIs, an SME may consider:
»How to reduce risks of ongoing personal data processing operations 
(e.g. adopting PETs or recruiting additional staff  )?
»Who are the responsible staff   for implementing KPIs?
»What are the business objectives of your target (e.g. the reduction 
of data subjects complaints by X%)
»How often to review progress and readjust KPIs?195
Adherence to certifications, although this does not ensure the 
eff  ectiveness of the measure per se, can be used as a support to 
demonstrate compliance.

what-is-a-key-performance-indicator .
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
107What does data protection by default entail?
Controllers shall also implement appropriate technical and organizational 
measures ensuring that, by default, only the personal data that is 
necessary for each specific purpose of the processing is processed. 
A ‘default’, as commonly defined in computer science, refers to the 
pre-existing or preselected value of a configurable setting that is 
assigned to a software application, computer program, or device. Such 
settings are also called ‘presets’ or ‘factory presets’, especially for 
electronic devices.196 Hence, ‘data protection by default’, in technical 
terms, refers to the choices made by a controller regarding any 
pre-existing configuration value or processing option that is assigned in 
a software application, computer program, or device that has the eff  ect 
of adjusting, in particular, but not limited to, the amount of personal 
data collected, the extent of its processing, and the period of its storage. 
The idea here is that, typically, a data subject making default choices 
should have their data adequately protected. 
What are some examples of measures implementing data 
protection by default? 
To implement technical measures putting in practice data protection by 
default, SMEs can, for example:
»customize the personal data to be provided by their clients 
depending on the services requested (which aff  ects the amount of 
personal data collected);
196 Footnote 160, para 39.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
108EXAMPLE
If a bookshop considers also selling books online, both in paper and 
in e-book formats, it presents customers with diff  erent versions of its 
order page. If it provides access to a digital book, it does not need to 
know the physical address of the customer.
»adopt clear policies concerning data deletion (i.e. aff  ecting the 
period of storage);
EXAMPLE
A sports centre is required by law to ask clients to provide medical 
authorization for enrolment. The certificates should be destroyed as 
soon as the membership expires (unless otherwise required by law).
»avoid pre-ticked boxes that nudge the clients to accept the 
provision of extra services (i.e. aff  ect the extent of processing).
EXAMPLE
When setting up cookies on its website, a company avoids pre-ticking 
the boxes for unnecessary cookies.
To implement organizational measures aimed at data protection by 
default, SMEs can establish access control policies governing employee 
access to personal data. This means limiting the number of employees 
who can have access to personal data based on an assessment of 
necessity, and also ensure that personal data is accessible to those who 
need it when necessary.  
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
109EXAMPLES
A company may consider preventing access to clients’ data by its 
human resources department because this is not necessary for the 
performance of their tasks.
A hotel manager may not disclose the contact details of guests to 
the cleaning or restaurant staff  , as this is not necessary for them to 
perform their job.

1103.7.3. Records of processing activities and other 
documentation 
Background 
Keeping a record of processing activities is a very useful means to 
understand the implications of any processing, whether existing or 
planned. The record facilitates the factual assessment of the risk to 
individuals’ rights of the processing activities performed by a controller 
or processor, and the identification and implementation of appropriate 
security measures to safeguard personal data.
For many micro-, small-, and medium-sized organizations, where data 
processing does not represent the core business, maintaining a record 
of processing activities may not necessarily be a burdensome activity. 
Conversely, it could be a tool to strengthen the good governance of 
an SME. Good records help in the preparation of an accurate data 
protection notice and provision of information to data subjects.
What does documentation require?
Both controllers and processors are required to keep records of their 
processing activities, albeit with some diff  erences. Documentation 
requirements for processors are less extensive.
EXAMPLE
The documentation, for SMEs acting as controllers should include 
information about the following:
»the name and contact details of the controller/representative/DPO;
»the purpose(s) of the processing;
»the categories (e.g. clients, employees, etc.) of data subjects and 
personal data processed (e.g. contact details, unique identifiers, 
social security number, etc.);
»the categories of recipients (e.g. marketing service providers) with 
whom the data may be shared, specifying if they are outside the 
European Economic Area (EEA) or an international organization;
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
111»in the case of international data transfers (sending personal data 
outside the EEA), the identification of the country outside the 
European Economic Area or the international organization to which 
personal data is transferred;
»where possible, the applicable data retention periods; and
»where possible, a description of the security measures (e.g. 
encryption) implemented in respect to the processed data.
For SMEs acting as processors, the information must include:
»the name and contact details of the processor/representative/DPO/
controller on behalf of which the processor is acting;
»categories of processing carried out on behalf of the controller;
»in the case of international data transfers, the identification of the 
country outside the European Economic Area or the international 
organization to which personal data is transferred; and
»where possible, a description of the security measures implemented 
in respect to the processed data.
SUGGESTION
Although not expressly required, it is best practice to also include in the 
register the legal basis governing the processing of personal data or its 
transfer to countries outside the EEA.197 The register may also include 
written data-sharing agreements between the (joint) controller(s), the 
controller and the processor, the processor and the sub-processor.
The GDPR does not explicitly require controllers to maintain detailed 
records of all data transfers. Yet, keeping documentation falls under 
scope of the principle of accountability, and allows the controller to 
demonstrate the lawfulness of data processing. This obligation can 
be best met by recording all the details of personal data transfers. 
This also supports the notification of recipients if data needs to be 
rectified or erased in order to enact a data subject’s rights.
197 See Section 2.4 What are the possible legal bases for personal data processing?
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
112When discussing documentation, several alternative terms are used, 
such as, an inventory, a register, and a data management plan. Upon 
request, these records must be disclosed to the supervisory authority 
(DPA). Keeping accurate documentation of processing activities can be 
useful for an entity if it needs to demonstrate compliance.
The documentation of processing activities must be kept in writing.198
The controller (and the processor) chooses whether to keep such 
records in paper or electronic form. 
SUGGESTION
Maintaining documentation electronically has the advantage of 
allowing it to be easily modified by addition, removal and amendment. 
Paper documentation is, however, regarded as appropriate for SMEs 
and micro-enterprises.
In principle, SMEs are exempted from the obligation to keep a register of 
processing activities when: 
»the processing is not likely to result in a risk to the rights and 
freedoms of data subjects; 
»the processing is occasional (i.e. not regularly/frequently 
undertaken); or
»the processing does not include special categories of data or 
personal data relating to criminal convictions and off  ences. 
In practice, however, most SMEs will have to keep documentation of 
data processing activities.
198 Based on the opinions and guidance provided by the UK DPA (ICO), the French DPA 
(CNIL) and the Irish DPA. 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
113EXAMPLES
A paper factory regularly processes personal data in the context of 
sales and HR. Even if the company has fewer than 250 staff  , it must 
still document these types of processing activities, because they are 
not occasional. Furthermore, most employees’ files include special 
categories of personal data.
An insurance company occasionally carries out an internal staff   
engagement survey. Since the company does not perform this 
particular processing activity often, it does not need to document it 
as part of its record of processing activities. However, if the company 
occasionally performs profiling activities across its customer database, 
for insurance-risk classification, then the company must document 
such processing. This processing entails profiling – a risky processing 
operation.199
A tattooist may be legally required to ask for their clients’ medical 
certificates before tattooing them. In this case, the tattooist keeps a 
record of the processing activities concerning the health-related data 
of their clients.
A commercial activity (e.g. bar, pub, restaurant, hairdresser, 
beautician) with at least one employee keeps a record of processing 
activities in relation to the processing of the employee’s data.200

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
114SUGGESTION
Even for SMEs falling within the exemption, it would be convenient 
to maintain a record of the occasional processing activities. This 
way, it would be much easier for them to cooperate with DPAs if an 
investigation is initiated, and to demonstrate compliance with GDPR 
requirements.201
Processors and controllers can put in place a single set of shared records 
that they can quickly make available to the DPA upon request. If an 
organization simultaneously acts as both controller and processor for 
a particular activity, the records may be split up to correspond to those 
respective roles.202
What are the other types of documentation required by the 
GDPR?
Other than keeping a record of the processing activities, other types of 
documentation should also be kept in writing. These support processors 
and controllers in their duty of demonstrating their accountability and 
compliance with the GDPR. 
Some are expressly required by the GDPR, others are best practices. For 
example:
»keeping a registry of data protection risks;
»concluding written agreements between (joint) controllers, 
controllers and processors, and processors and sub-processors, 
specifying reciprocal roles and responsibilities;
»keeping track of DPO advice (e.g. mail, written opinions, etc.); 
»keeping track of the decision on the (non-)appointment of a DPO;

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
116SUGGESTION
When downloading a template for documentation purposes prepared 
by a DPA, an SME should consider whether it acts as a controller or 
as a processor within the particular processing operation(s), as the 
information required will diff  er.
3.7.4. Security of processing
Background
Controllers and processors are requested to implement appropriate 
technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security 
appropriate to the risk. Such measures may include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
»the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
»the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, 
availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;
»the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data 
in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
»a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the eff  ec-
tiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the 
security of the processing.
How is the security obligation related to other provisions?
Security obligations also require the controller wishing to engage a 
processor under contract to undertake due diligence and assess whether 
the guarantees off  ered by the processor are suffi   cient. A controller must 
only engage a processor where they have faith in their ability to comply 
with the obligations under GDPR. 
Within the due diligence process, the controller may take into account 
whether the processor provides adequate documentation proving 
compliance with data protection principles found in privacy policies, 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
117records management policies, information security policies, external 
audit reports, certifications, and similar documentation. The controller 
should in particular take into account the processor’s expert knowledge 
(e.g. technical expertise when dealing with data breaches and security 
measures) and reliability, as well as its resources. A site visit may also be 
necessary. After carrying out the due diligence process, the controller 
should be able to make a decision on the basis of suffi   cient evidence 
demonstrating that the processor is suitable, and it can then enter into 
a binding arrangement.
This due diligence process is not a one-time eff  ort. The controller has 
an ongoing obligation to check whether the processor is compliant and 
meeting their obligations by means of auditing, either by using their 
own staff   or a trusted third party. When outsourcing the processing of 
personal data (e.g. for the provision of technical assistance or cloud 
services), the controller must conclude a contract, another legal act, 
or binding arrangement with the other entity, which sets out clear and 
precise data protection obligations and the nature of the processing in 
a detailed data processing agreement.
SUGGESTION
Keeping written documentation of the due diligence process explaining 
why the controller considered the processor suitable may be useful 
to demonstrate compliance and accountability in the event of an 
investigation by a DPA.
What organizational security measures can an SME take?
»Carrying out a risk assessment of personal data at hand. Such a 
risk assessment would focus on the risks arising from an accidental 
or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure 
of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise 
processed. In short, the assessment would anticipate risks that a 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
118data breach could aff  ect data subjects.
»Build a culture of security awareness within the organization by 
participating in training activities. 
»Have an information security policy foreseeing the role of each user 
and the required permission levels. Such an access control policy 
would define roles that may be given access to personal data, and 
in this way limit access to data that is necessary for that role (e.g. 
system administrator accounts). Furthermore, such a policy could 
be used to demonstrate responsible behaviour of the controller 
(Article 24) and facilitate compliance with the GDPR requirements.
SUGGESTION
A DPO could play a significant role in setting organizational security 
measures by awareness-raising, training, and regular auditing of staff   
handling personal data.
What technical security measures can an SME take?
Technical security measures are sometimes thought of as the protection 
of personal data held in computers and networks. Whilst these are of 
obvious importance, many security incidents can be due to the theft 
or loss of equipment, the abandonment of old computers or hard-copy 
records being lost, stolen, or incorrectly disposed of. Technical measures 
must, therefore, include both physical and computer or information 
technology (IT) security.
When considering physical security, the following elements are relevant:
»the quality of doors and locks, and the protection of the business 
premises by means such as alarms, security lighting and/or CCTV;
»the access control to business premises as well as the supervision 
of visitors;
»the disposal of any paper and electronic waste; and
»the secure storage of IT equipment, particularly mobile devices.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
119In the IT context, technical measures may sometimes be referred to 
as ‘cybersecurity’. This is a complex technical area that is constantly 
evolving, with new threats and vulnerabilities constantly emerging. 
When considering cybersecurity, factors to be looked at include:
»system security – the security of the networks and information 
systems used by the company, especially those which process 
personal data;
»data security – the security of the data held within the systems (e.g. 
ensuring appropriate access controls are in place and that data are 
held securely through the use of suitable levels of encryption);
»online security – e.g. the security of the website and any other 
online service or application used by the company; and
»device security – including policies on Bring-Your-Own-Device 
(BYOD).
What level of security is required?
The GDPR does not define security measures that an SME should have 
in place. Controllers and processors are only required to have a level of 
security that is ‘appropriate’. Both controllers and processors need to 
consider the appropriateness in relation to the risks to the rights and 
freedoms of natural persons, current technological capabilities, and 
costs of implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context, and 
purpose of the processing.
This reflects both the GDPR’s risk-based approach and the fact that there 
is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to information security. It means that 
what is ‘appropriate’ for each controller and processor depends on their 
circumstances, the processing in which they are engaged, and the risks 
it presents to their organization as well as to the rights and freedoms of 
data subjects. Where special categories of data are processed (such as 
health data) or personal data relating to minors, higher levels of security 
are expected to be implemented and documented.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
120Before deciding on appropriate measures, an SME needs to assess its 
personal data risk. An SME should review the personal data held and the 
way this information is used, in order to assess how valuable, sensitive, 
or confidential it is – as well as the damage or distress that could be 
caused if the data was to be compromised. 
Other factors to consider are:
»the nature and extent of the organization’s premises and computer 
systems;
»the number of staff  , and the extent of their access to personal data; and
»if any personal data is held or used by a processor.

3.7.5. Personal data breach notification
Background
A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the 
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized 
disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or 
otherwise processed.203 Breach of the GDPR by lack of an adequate legal 
basis for a processing operation or providing inadequate information 
203 Article 4(12) GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
121to data subjects does not create obligations related to personal data 
breach notifications. Furthermore, a breach of information security 
which does not compromise personal data also does not fall within the 
scope of this obligation.204 That is why not all security incidents are 
considered personal data breaches, but every personal data breach 
entails a security incident. Among the most common causes of data 
breaches, are negligence, accident or technical failure, and intentional 
acts by internal or external actors.205
When the personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights 
and freedoms of natural persons, the controller is required to notify the 
competent DPA. When the risk to the rights and freedoms is high, the 
notification about a personal data breach should also be communicated 
to the data subject.
An obligation to notify of a personal data breach is both an accountability 
obligation and an obligation that requires taking ‘additional measures 
when specific risks are identified’.206 While being an accountability 
obligation, a data breach notification is also part of a controller’s 
obligations, which ‘can and should be varied according to the type of 
processing and the privacy risks for data subjects.’207 Identification of 
risk of a personal data breach in the data protection impact assessment 
would require controllers to put appropriate measures in place to ‘treat 
risk’ by modifying, mitigating, retaining, removing, or sharing it.

207 Ibid.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
122Under what conditions is a notification to the DPA required?
The GDPR requires that in situations where the data breach is likely 
to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, ‘the 
controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 
72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data 
breach to the supervisory authority’.208
At a minimum the notification must include: 
»a description of the nature (e.g. deliberate, accidental, loss, 
destruction, etc.) of the data breach;
»the categories and approximate number of data subjects involved 
(if possible);
»the categories and approximate number of personal data records 
(if possible);
»the contact details of the DPO that will act as the contact point with 
the DPA;
»a description of the likely consequences of the data breach; and
»the measures the controller will implement to address the breach, 
to eventually mitigate its adverse eff  ects.
SUGGESTION
If not all information about a data breach is available at once, it can be 
provided to the relevant DPA in phases.
To implement this obligation, the controller must become aware of 
the personal data breach. This means that the controller must have 
an internal procedure allowing them to confirm that there has been a 
breach of security concerning personal data. The GDPR does not specify 
the practical aspects of such a procedure. 
208 Article 33(1) GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
123However, for smooth running and management, any entity handling 
information, including processing personal data, must have appropriate 
governance or organizational structures in place, where roles and 
responsibilities of individuals involved are specified in internal policy 
and strategy documents. 
Such documents can be developed based on standards, guidelines, and 
models provided by external sources. Yet, they must consider relationships 
within the entity, its values and culture, as well as its contractual 
relationships. This contextual awareness, in combination with awareness 
of a data breach risk, is essential when developing an information incident 
response policy and plan, which can include obligations stemming from 
the GDPR as well as other regulatory frameworks (e.g. NIS Directive or 
the Payment Services Directive (PSD 2)).
SUGGESTION
An information incident response policy should be created before an 
incident occurs, so that it can be used if a data breach is detected.
The GDPR requires that all data breaches, regardless of whether these 
are notified to the DPA or communicated to the data subjects, are 
documented. Such documentation should furthermore include eff  ects 
and remedial actions taken in response to a personal data breach.
What documentation could help an SME to prepare for a data breach?
Having the following documents in place could assist in the event of a 
(personal) data breach: 
1. A policy is a high-level document outlining the goal and objective of 
the incident response program, the scope of the program across the 
organization, program roles, responsibilities, and authority, and how 
program outputs, such as incident communication and reporting, will 
be managed.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
1242. A plan is a formal document outlining how the high-level policy 
document will be implemented and operationalized within the 
organization. Core elements of a security incident response plan 
include communication protocols that will be used to manage the 
sharing of incident updates and reports with internal and external 
stakeholders, metrics for measuring the eff  ectiveness of the program, 
events that would trigger an update to the plan, and a strategy to 
improve and mature the plan over time.
3. Standard Operating Procedures  (SOPs) are documents containing 
technical step-by-step actions that the CSIRT (Cyber Security Incident 
Response Team) will take to manage specific incidents. SOPs help 
minimize incident management errors and ensure a consistent and 
repeatable incident management capability. SOPs traditionally also 
include the forms and checklists that will be used by CSIRT members 
in the execution of the CSIR plan.209
Under what conditions is a notification to aff  ected individuals 
required?
Individuals have to be notified when the breach is likely to result in a 
high risk to their rights and freedoms. The threshold for the notification 
to individuals is higher than for notifications to DPAs, so that individuals 
are protected from ‘unnecessary notification fatigue’ and do not receive 
notifications about all breaches.210
The following elements can help to determine if the breach entails a 
high risk:
»The type of breach : the WP29 deems that the level of risk presented 
by data breaches depends upon whether the breach concerns 
the principle of confidentiality, the principle of integrity and/or 
209 Fowler, K., Data Breach Preparation and Response: Breaches Are Certain, Impact Is 
Not, Kindle (Syngress 2016) 50.

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
125the principle of availability.211 However, data breaches typically 
have diff  erent motivations: they can be financially motivated 
cybercrimes, cyber espionage (concerning national security or 
economic interests), or acts aiming to publicly humiliate someone 
without any intention of achieving financial gains.212
»The nature, sensitivity, and volume of personal data : the risk 
evaluation largely depends on the sensitivity of personal data 
that was subject to a data breach. However, this sensitivity is 
often contextual (e.g. a name and address could be sensitive 
if it concerns an adoptive parent), similarly to considerations 
concerning the volume of breached data. While typically the larger 
the volume of data breached, the greater the impact that may be 
anticipated, ‘a small amount of highly sensitive personal data can 
have a high impact on an individual.’213 It is also recognized that 
while data breaches concerning health data, identity documents, 
and credit card details entail risks, the possibility of combining this 
data creates higher risk than a single piece of information, as it 
could subsequently facilitate identity theft.214
»Ease of identification of individuals : when evaluating risks associated 
with a data breach, it is also important to consider whether the 
identification of individuals who were subject to a breach is going to 
be easy. In this regard, the controllers should consider whether the 
compromised data can be matched with other datasets, and what 
kinds of security measures have been implemented (e.g., what is the 
level of hashing, encryption, or pseudonymization).

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
126»The severity of consequences for individuals : the WP29 argues 
that by taking into account the nature of the personal data involved 
in a breach (e.g., access to special categories of data, financial data) 
controllers can anticipate the potential damage to individuals. 
»Special characteristics of the individual : the controller, when 
evaluating the impact on individuals, needs to consider, for 
example, if the breach concerns personal data about vulnerable 
individuals. Vulnerable data subjects may include children (they 
can be considered as being incapable of knowingly and thoughtfully 
opposing or consenting to the processing of their data), employees 
(in relation to their employers due to the subordinate power 
relationship that exists between them), and other vulnerable 
segments of the population requiring special protection (e.g. 
mentally ill persons, asylum seekers, the elderly, medical patients, 
etc.). Even if individuals are not part of a group that might automat-
ically be considered vulnerable, an imbalance of power in their 
relationship with the controller can cause vulnerability for data 
protection purposes, if such individuals would be disadvantaged in 
the event that the processing of personal data is not performed. 
»Special characteristics of the controller : the WP29 suggests that 
‘[t]he nature and role of the controller and its activities may aff  ect 
the level of risk to individuals as a result of a breach.’215
EXAMPLE
A private clinic may process special categories of data that – if 
accessed without authorization – may be used to cause harm to its 
patients (e.g. by blackmailing them).
»The number of aff  ected individuals : finally, the controller needs 
to assess the amount of personal data that was compromised. In

3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
127general, it is argued that large-scale data breaches will have a more 
severe impact. However, a personal data breach involving special 
categories of personal data of one person can have a severe impact 
as well.216
As the GDPR matures, diff  erent DPAs have begun to express diff  erent 
thresholds for the reporting of breaches. The Irish Data Protection 
Commission, for example, provides guidance with more specific 
scenarios explaining when notifications concerning personal data 
breaches should be made by the controller.217
SUGGESTION
In case of a data breach, consult the relevant DPA website to obtain 
a notification form. It often includes questionnaires facilitating risk 
assessment.

3.7.6. Data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and 
prior consultation
Background
A requirement to conduct a DPIA is a new addition to the EU data 
protection framework. It builds on the rich experience of conducting 
impact assessments in other fields (e.g. privacy impact assessment, 
environmental impact assessment, regulatory impact assessment). 
To be eff  ective, impact assessments are carried out at the early stage 
of a project (proactive initiative), at the phase of planning or designing, 
with the aim of anticipating the potential beneficial and adverse (i.e. 
negative) impacts of such a project. Impact assessments help decision-
makers find the best and most beneficial solutions for the development 
and deployment of initiatives.218 To be practical, impact assessment 
must be scalable, flexible, and applicable for large organizations, 
consortiums, or small- and medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, they 
are not one-time eff  orts; they need to be periodically revised to make 
sure they reflect the changes in the reality surrounding the project.
218 E.g. environmental impact assessments originated from Green movements in the 
1960s (read more at: ‘International Association for Impact Assessment: Principles of 
Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice’ https://www.eianz.org/document/
item/2744 ) and social impact assessments (SIA) were developed in the 1980s. SIAs 
aim to ensure that developments or planned interventions maximize the benefits 
and minimize the costs of those developments, including, especially, costs borne by 
the community (for more information read: ‘The Interorganizational Committee on 
Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment: Guidelines and Principles for 
Social Impact Assessment https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07349165.1
994.9725857 ’).
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
129Accordingly, a DPIA process under GDPR also has to begin before the 
start of personal data processing operations, and ideally already at 
the design or planning phase. A DPIA cannot be used retrospectively 
to justify a particular decision (e.g. buying a drone, installing CCTV). 
Conversely, the DPIA has been conceived as a tool to shape the 
envisaged processing operations, to ensure that controllers are thinking 
about data protection implications from the outset and adopt the most 
privacy-friendly approach possible, in order to minimize the negative 
consequences that the processing operations could have on the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and natural persons.
DPIAs, as with other types of impact assessments, constitute a 
best-eff  orts obligation . It is impossible to reduce negative consequences 
to zero in absolute terms, but SMEs have to react to them to the best 
of their ability, depending upon current technological capabilities and 
their available resources.219 Yet, the protection of personal data and 
compliance with the GDPR must be ensured.220
Who has to perform a DPIA?
A DPIA is only mandatory for SMEs acting as controllers, and only for 
certain processing operations. Whilst the processor and the DPO should 
assist, the controller bears overall responsibility for the DPIA process.
SUGGESTION
SMEs acting as processors may choose to perform a DPIA voluntarily 
for the following reasons: to enhance their awareness of the data 
processing operations and the functioning of their systems; to ensure 
that their organizational standards are complied with; to increase their 
trustworthiness; to demonstrate commitment towards data protection; 
to demonstrate suffi   cient guarantees to controllers.
219 Footnote 176, 2.
220 Article 35(7)(d) GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
130A DPIA can also be useful for assessing the data protection impact of 
a technology product (e.g. if the SME develops a piece of hardware 
or software, or if it off  ers data shredding and sanitizing services or 
cloud-based storage).221
As to the assessors , i.e. the persons or companies who perform the 
assessment in practice, the controller can choose to outsource the DPIA 
or to perform it themselves relying on in-house expertise.
When is a DPIA mandatory?
Not all processing operations require a DPIA, only those ‘ likely to result 
in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into 
account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing’ . 
The GDPR refers to rights and freedoms of natural persons, not just 
of data subjects, because a processing operation can present risks to 
natural persons whose personal data is not processed.
EXAMPLE
In the case of self-driving vehicles, a pedestrian may not be a data 
subject, but they are still a natural person whose life and health are 
endangered by the self-driving car.
Among the rights and freedoms that can be put at stake by the processing
operations are:
»the data subject’s rights as listed in the GDPR (e.g. right to access, 
right to erasure, rights to data portability, etc., see 2.5 What are 
data subjects’ rights?); 
» other fundamental rights and freedoms, such as respect for private 
and family life, home and communications; freedom of thought, 
221 Footnote 141, 8.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
131conscience, and religion; freedom of expression and information; 
freedom to conduct a business; right to an eff  ective remedy and to 
a fair trial; right to cultural, religious and linguistic diversity; right to 
non-discrimination; and many more.222
It is at the controller’s discretion to determine whether the envisaged 
processing operations fall within the pre-defined high-risk criteria.223
However, certain elements may qualify the processing operations as 
‘likely to result in a high risk’ for natural persons. 
EXAMPLES
There is an inherent high risk  in processing operations entailing: 
1. evaluation or scoring, including profiling and predicting;
2. automated decision-making with a legal or similar significant 
impact;
3. systematic monitoring;
4. sensitive data or data of a highly personal nature (e.g. financial 
data, geolocation data);
5. data processed on a large scale;
6. matching or combining datasets; 
7. data concerning vulnerable data subjects (e.g. children, asylum 
seekers, elderly people, patients);
8. the use of innovative or new technological or organizational 
solutions (e.g. artificial intelligence, wearable devices);
222 For other examples of fundamental rights, please refer, inter alia , to the Charter 
of Fundamental Rights of the European Union https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT , the European Convention on Human 
Rights https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf  and to the 
constitutional documents of Member States.
223 Footnote 176, 3.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
1329. situations where the processing in itself ‘prevents data subjects 
from exercising a right or using a service or a contract.’ (e.g. 
denying service to a (potential) customer due to their profile).
 The controller may use these criteria to evaluate if the processing 
operations entail a high risk for DPIA purposes, but they are not 
applicable when the controller has to evaluate whether to notify an 
individual of a data breach.224
The GDPR provides three examples of processing operations that, by 
their nature, entail high risks to rights and freedoms of individuals. They 
are:
a. the systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating 
to natural persons based on automated processing, including 
profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal eff  ects 
concerning the natural person or similarly significantly aff  ect the 
natural person;
EXAMPLES
An insurance company relying on profiling to build insurance-risk 
classifications and determine premiums should perform a DPIA.
A company relying on an automated system for checking CVs for 
recruiting should perform a DPIA.
A retailer relying on an automated system to quantify bonuses for 
employees on the basis of their individual performance at work should 
carry out a DPIA.
224 Footnote 141, 6.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
133b. the processing of special categories of data on a large scale, or of 
personal data relating to criminal convictions and off  ences;
EXAMPLES
A private health clinic processing its clients’ data should perform a 
DPIA. 
A company developing a dating app collecting information about the 
sexual preferences of its users should perform a DPIA. 
A company developing a period tracker that is going to provide 
individualized cycle tracking with calendar and associated individual-
ized predictions, reminders and notifications should perform a DPIA.
c. the systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.
EXAMPLES
A security company providing CCTV monitoring services in a shopping 
centre or a public transport station should perform a DPIA.
A care home for mentally disabled people that is implementing a 
surveillance system based on high resolution cameras combined with 
a software capable of detecting abnormal behaviour of guests should 
conduct a DPIA.
A company that monitors the metadata (meaning the information 
pertaining to data) related to the use of its applications in order to 
improve its services should conduct a DPIA.
A company developing a mobile application specifically for celiac 
individuals that, on the basis of the geolocation of the device, 
suggests the closest shop where they can buy gluten-free products, 
should conduct a DPIA.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
134National DPAs compile and publish lists of processing operations 
that always require a DPIA. A DPIA is mandatory when the envisaged 
processing operations are included in this list.225
SUGGESTION
The lists of processing operations requiring a DPIA vary per country. 
Therefore, consult the website of the national DPA.
In principle, codes of conduct may also act as a guide to whether a DPIA 
is required or desirable.
EXAMPLES
Situations that may require carrying out a DPIA: 
»a jeweller planning to implement a tool to monitor access to a safe 
combining the use of fingerprints and facial recognition;
»a biotechnology company off  ering genetic tests directly to 
consumers to assess and predict disease/health risks;
»a company monitoring social media data to create profiles of clients 
or employees;
»eHealth app developers; 
»a company implementing an automatic staff   appraisal for assigning 
bonuses to its employees to increase salaries; 
»an insurance company ranking clients for the purpose of providing 
them with insurance services; and
»a private investigation service that handles data concerning criminal 
convictions and off  ences.
225 Article 35(4) GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
135When is a DPIA not required?
The GDPR foresees the following situations where a DPIA process is not 
required:
»When the data processing operations are included in the list of data 
processing operations not requiring a DPIA compiled by the DPA(s) 
to whose jurisdiction(s) the controller is subject.
SUGGESTION
The lists of processing operations (not) requiring a DPIA may be found 
on the website of the national DPA.
»When the personal data is processed (1) in order to comply with a 
legal obligation or in the public interest; (2) on the basis of EU law 
or the Member State’s law; and (3) when an impact assessment 
essentially satisfying the conditions laid down in the GDPR has 
already been performed in the context of the adoption of that legal 
basis (albeit in very few cases will this be relevant for SMEs).
»When processing operations concern personal data from patients 
or clients by an individual physician, other health care professional, 
or lawyer, they are not required to carry out a DPIA because they 
are not processing personal data on a large scale.
Just because there is no obligation to conduct a DPIA does not mean 
that a controller’s general obligation to implement measures to 
appropriately manage risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects 
is diminished. The requirement to have appropriate technical and 
organization measures to mitigate the likelihood and severity of risks 
forms a part of general controller obligations, data protection by design 
and by default, and data security. This requirement exists regardless of 
whether the requirement to conduct a DPIA applies or not.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
136In case of doubt as to whether to conduct a DPIA or not, it is best practice 
to consult a DPO or person responsible for personal data processing 
operations, in order to determine whether there is a need to conduct 
the DPIA process.
When is a new (revised) DPIA required?
The risk-based approach entails that controllers must continuously 
assess the risks created by their processing activities in order to identify 
when a type of processing is ‘likely to result in a high risk to the rights 
and freedoms of natural persons’.226 In practice, this means that the 
DPIA needs to be periodically revised. The revision of a DPIA is not only 
useful for continuous improvement, but also critical to maintaining the 
level of data protection in a changing environment over time.
A new (i.e. revised version of a) DPIA could be required if the risks 
resulting from the processing operations change, for example, because 
a new technology or organizational solution has been introduced or 
because personal data is being used for a diff  erent purpose.227 Data 
processing operations can evolve quickly, and new vulnerabilities can 
arise. In this sense, data breaches and security incidents could increase 
awareness regarding risks connected to the processing operations and 
trigger a revision of the DPIA. A new DPIA may also become necessary 
because the organizational or societal context for the processing 
activity has changed, for example, when new rules on data protection 
or data protection impact assessments are adopted in the jurisdiction 
where the controller is operating, when the eff  ects of certain automated 
decisions have become more significant, or again when new categories 
of data subjects become vulnerable to discrimination. 
226 Footnote 141, 6.
227 Idem, 13-14.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
137Each of these examples could be an element that leads to a change in 
the risk analysis concerning the processing activity at hand. Conversely, 
certain changes could lower the risk as well. For example, a processing 
operation could evolve so that decisions are no longer automated or 
when a monitoring activity is no longer systematic. In that case, the 
review of the risk analysis undertaken can show that the performance of 
a DPIA is no longer required.
How should a DPIA be conducted?
The GDPR provides controllers with a lot of flexibility in determining the 
precise structure and form of the DPIA. Many methods for conducting 
the DPIA process exist, originating from the public and private sectors 
and academia alike.228
The steps marked with * are not expressly required by the GDPR, but 
have emerged as either best practice or for practical reasons.

prospective, in the sense that they are triggered only if certain conditions 
are met. Steps A, B and C are ongoing, in the sense that stakeholder 
consultation, documentation, and quality control have to be reflected in 
all of the other phases.
Step 1: Screening  (threshold analysis ) 
In this step, the controller, with the help of the DPO if appointed, drafts 
a preliminary description of the envisaged processing operations. 
Based on that, it should be possible to determine if the DPIA process 
is required (i.e. the processing operations are likely to result in a high 
risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons) or not (because 
the processing operations are not likely to result in a high risk, or an 
exemption applies). If the latter, then it is best practice for the SME 
to document the decision by issuing a statement of non-significant 
impact, explaining why the DPIA was not performed.
Step 2: Scoping * 
In this step, the controller determines: 
a. the benchmark, i.e. what aspects of the fundamental right to 
personal data protection (e.g. the exercise of data subjects’ rights, 
the conditions of the consent) and what other fundamental rights are 
likely to be aff  ected by the envisaged data processing operation(s); 
b. which stakeholders to involve in the process. They must include, at 
least: the concerned data subjects and their representatives (e.g. 
NGOs),229 the DPO,230 and the processor;231
c. which techniques will be used for assessing the impacts. The GDPR 
mentions only assessment of the necessity and proportionality of 
the processing operations and the risk appraisal for the rights and 
freedoms of natural persons. However, these can be combined with 
229 Article 35(9) GDPR.
230 Article 39(1)(c) GDPR.
231 Article 28(3)(f) GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
139other techniques. For example, scenario analysis (to compare the 
possible diff  erent outcomes of the processing operations with the 
adoption of diff  erent mitigation measures) or cost-benefit analysis 
(to identify the mitigation measures to address the impacts having 
regard to the (economic) resources available to the controller);
d. what other evaluation techniques need to be used (if any). For 
example, if the initiative aff  ects the environment, together with the 
DPIA, environmental impact assessment (EIA) may be warranted 
or required by law. Similarly, if an initiative aff  ects human health, 
a health impact assessment may be required by law, or an ethics 
impact assessment may be desirable.
Step 3: Planning and preparation * 
In this step, the controller specifies: 
a. the objectives/goals of the assessment process; 
b. the criteria for the risk acceptance (risk criteria) and for justifying the 
necessity and proportionality of the processing operations;
c. the resources necessary to conduct the DPIA, in terms of time, money, 
workforce, knowledge, know-how, premises and infrastructure;
d. the procedures and time frames of the assessment process, to define 
the (reciprocal) responsibilities of the actors involved DPIA process, 
set deadlines and calendarize the milestones; 
e. the criteria for choosing the team of assessors, their roles and 
responsibilities; 
f. the modalities to ensure the continuity of the assessment process, 
regardless of any disruptions such as changes in the parties involved 
in the assessment process (e.g., controller, processors, assessors); 
natural disasters; utility failures, etc.; and
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
140g. the criteria triggering the revision of the process. As well as a change 
in the level of risk,232 others are possible. For example, the controller 
may establish periodic reviews of the DPIA process. 
Step 4: Description
In this step, by widening the preliminary description, the envisaged 
processing operation(s) are described both contextually and technically. 
The nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing operations 
are clarified, as well as any legitimate interest pursued by the controller.233
Step 5: Appraisal ofimpacts
In this step, the necessity and proportionally of the envisaged processing 
operation(s), and the risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals 
stemming therefrom are assessed. 
For the necessity and proportionality test, each data processing 
operation is assessed against personal data protection principles. 
These are: lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, 
data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, and integrity and 
confidentiality.
For the risk assessment, a typical method requires, first of all, a risk 
to be identified and described; second, the risk must be analysed to 
determine its level/magnitude; third, the risk must be evaluated: the 
results of risk analysis are compared with risk criteria (cf. Step 3b) in 
order to determine whether the risk and its level are acceptable, if any 
mitigation measure is to be recommended, and/or whether any risk 
needs to be treated as a priority.
Step 6: Recommendations and remediation
In this step, mitigation measures to address the risks identified in the 
previous step and to demonstrate compliance with the law are suggested . 
232 Article 35(11) GDPR.
233 Article 35(7)(a) GDPR.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
141For each data protection principle not satisfied in the previous step, the 
assessor(s) recommends measures to satisfy these principle (e.g. not 
to collect a certain type of personal data, in order to comply with data 
minimization; to reduce the data retention period).
Risk can be mitigated by manipulating either its likelihood or probability, 
e.g. by eliminating the exposure to a risk or severity (e.g. preparing a 
response plan should the risk materialize), or both. Risks can be avoided, 
mitigated, transferred (to another entity, e.g. outsource, insurance etc. 
or in time) or accepted. Residual risk is the risk that remains if there is 
no measure available to mitigate it and triggers a prior consultation with 
a DPA ( cf. Step 7).
The mitigation measures can be both technical and organizational. 
They can include defining policies and procedures for the protection of 
data; allocating defined roles and responsibilities as to the processing 
of personal data; establishing access control policies to personal data; 
creating a data breach response plan; setting up a business continuity 
plan; implementing logging and monitoring of data access; using a data 
deletion and disposal tool; etc.234
SUGGESTION
To demonstrate compliance, it is best practice to include the risks 
identified, their appraisal and their mitigation measures within a register. 
Furthermore, the register of risks, as well as the DPIA report, may be 
shared with the competent DPA for purposes of prior consultation.
Step 7: Prior consultation with a supervisory authority (or DPA)
In a scenario whereby the residual risk related to the processing

data-processing Annex A.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
142operations remains high despite the adoption of mitigation measures, 
but the controller decides they still want to go ahead with the processing 
operations, then the SME must consult the competent DPA. In principle, 
as an outcome of the prior consultation, the DPA will provide non-legally-
binding written advice. Nevertheless, the GDPR expressly foresees that 
the DPA could also use its powers (e.g. start an investigation, issue 
warnings).
SUGGESTION
Check your DPA website for a prior consultation form.
Step 8: Revisiting 
Revisiting (part of) the DPIA process (or reversing the statement of non-
significant impact) is mandatory when there is a change in the level of 
risk of the processing operations. 
a. Stakeholder involvement 
To ensure the decision making process is complete and inclusive, 
stakeholders are to be involved in all parts of the DPIA process. The 
controller should the views of the DPO, of the processor and, where 
appropriate, of the data subjects and of their representatives. Other 
stakeholders may also be included (e.g. information security offi   cer, 
if present). The views of the stakeholders are sought and taken into 
consideration (this is very useful for identifying risks to the rights and 
freedoms of the data subjects, which might not be apparent to the data 
controller themselves), but stakeholders cannot decide about the DPIA. 
Any final decisions are down to the controller.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
143b. Documentation* 
Keeping intelligible records, in writing or another permanent format, of 
all activities undertaken within the assessment process, is the easiest 
way to demonstrate accountability and compliance with the law. It is 
best practice to also keep track of the advice given by the stakeholders, 
DPO included, and of the reasons why such advice was (not) followed.
c. Quality control* 
The DPO is expressly tasked with monitoring the performance of the 
assessment process.235
SUGGESTION
To ensure that the DPIA process adheres to a given standard of 
performance, an SME can use a progress monitoring tool.

3.7.7. Codes of conduct
Background
The Member States, the European DPAs, the EDPB, and the Commission 
encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct that are intended to 
contribute to the proper application of the GDPR, taking into account 
the specific features of various processing sectors and the specific 
needs of SMEs. Codes of conduct are aimed at improving standards by 
clearly setting out best practices for the processing of personal data 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
145in a specific sector or business. They can concern either controllers or 
processors. 
While codes of conduct are voluntary sets of rules that are developed 
by an organization representing a sector or category of controllers or 
processors (e.g. an association, a chamber of commerce), compliance 
monitoring with reference to a code of conduct will be carried out by a 
body which has an appropriate level of expertise regarding the subject 
matter of the code, which is accredited for such a purpose by the 
competent supervisory authority.236
 The European Gaming and Betting Association (EGBA) has been 
among the first to publish a Code of Conduct on data protection which, 
once approved, will establish dedicated sector-specific rules and best 
practices to ensure compliance with the GDPR in the online gambling 
sector.237 The Code of Conduct prepared by EGBA has been sent for 
approval to the Maltese Data Protection Authority. It may take up to two 
years for this code to be reviewed and approved by the European data 
protection authorities and the European Data Protection Board.
Codes of conduct must go beyond the principles foreseen in the GDPR. 
They ‘must materially specify or enhance the application of data 
protection law to a certain sector or processing activity’.238 In practice, 
this means, for a DPA to approve a code of conduct applicable in its 
territory, or for the EDPB to approve a code of conduct applicable across 
several jurisdictions, or for the Commission to approve a code of conduct 
concerning transfers to third countries, such a code must specify the 
application of the GDPR and address the following:

website.

subjects;
»the transfer of personal data to third countries or international 
organizations; and 
»out-of-court proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures 
for resolving disputes between controllers and data subjects about 
the processing. 
What are the advantages of codes of conduct?
Where a relevant code of conduct exists, opting for it could be beneficial 
for an SME as it could facilitate its compliance with the GDPR requirements. 
This is particularly the case where data processing practices share 
many commonalities across a sector. It may be a cost-eff  ective way of 
reducing sources of non-compliance, and therefore the risk of fines. 
How to select the appropriate code of conduct?
When selecting a code of conduct under the GDPR, an SME should pay 
particular attention and evaluate whether it addresses the needs arising 
from the personal data processing operations that it runs. 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
147SUGGESTION
An SME should check whether the code of conduct has been approved 
by a DPA, or, where appropriate, by the EDPB or the European 
Commission. National codes of conduct will be published and made 
available on the public register of approved codes of conduct on the 
relevant DPA website; European codes of conduct will be published by 
the EDPB and, where relevant, by the European Commission.

3.7.8. Certification 
Background
The Member States, the DPAs, the EDPB, and the European Commission 
encourage the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms 
and data protection seals and marks for the purpose of demonstrating 
compliance with the GDPR. Such mechanisms can concern processing 
operations by controllers and processors.
The criteria by which to evaluate if a certification is within the scope of 
the GDPR are:
1. The certification concerns the processing operation. More precisely, 
when assessing a processing operation, the components to consider 
are the personal data (material scope of the GDPR); the technical 
systems and the infrastructure (such as hardware and software, used 
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
148to process the personal data); and processes and procedures related 
to the processing operation(s). 
2. The certification concerns personal data and privacy in a broad sense;
3. The voluntary nature of the certification; and
4. The performance of third-party conformity assessment. Certification 
can only be issued by a certification body accredited by the National 
Accreditation Body or by the competent supervisory authority, on 
the basis of criteria approved by that supervisory authority or by the 
EDPB. This means that self-certification schemes are excluded from 
the scope of Article 42 of the GDPR .239
What are the advantages of certifications for SMEs?
SMEs, both when acting as controllers and as processors, can benefit 
from certifications for the following reasons. 
First, certifications can enhance trust of data subjects and clients, both 
in business-to-consumer and in business-to-business relations, off  ering 
them greater transparency about the way(s) in which personal data is 
processed by controllers and processors.240
Second, certifications can reward privacy-aware technologies developed 
or employed by SMEs.241 Building upon these two aspects, certifications 
can off  er a competitive advantage for SMEs that opt for a certification 
scheme.242
239 Kamara, I. et al., ‘Data Protection Certification Mechanisms: Study on Articles 42 
and 43 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679: final report’
https:// ec.europa.eu/info/study-data-protection-certification-mechanisms_en 4, 5. 
240 Ibid.
241 Products and systems cannot be certified as such for being GDPR 
compliant, but they are part of the evaluation for awarding the certification 
for data-processing activities. See Kamara, I.  https://iapp.org/news/a/
four-gdpr-certification-myths-dispelled/ . 
242 Ibid.
3. The theory and practice of a risk-based approach
149Furthermore, in case of international data transfers (outside the EEA), 
a certification can be used as a means by which to demonstrate that 
appropriate safeguards are in place for a controller or processor not 
subject to the GDPR. In this case, the existence of certification can act 
as a legal basis for data transfers.243
The use of certifications does not prove compliance with the GDPR, 
but they can be used by controllers and processors as a way of 
demonstrating the implementation of appropriate technical and 
organizational measures; the existence of suffi   cient guarantees for 
processor-controller and sub-processor-processor relations.244
How should you choose between diff  erent certifications? 
At the time of writing, there are no approved GDPR certification 
schemes at a domestic or an EU level. National and international 
certification schemes exist, but these cannot be considered certification 
schemes under the GDPR. In other words, even when data-protection-
related, these certifications are not specifically tailored to the GDPR’s 
requirements.245
Existing national and international certifications diff  er greatly in 
scope. Some of them are fully related to data protection, while some 
are partially related to data protection, and yet others concern single 
aspects of data protection (e.g. cybersecurity). Certification models 
can be multisector (where they do not diff  erentiate among businesses) 
or single-sector (designed for specific business activities, such as 
cloud computing). Even within the multisector ones, there are multiple 
SME-friendly models. Some apply a pricing policy tailored to the size of

150the applicant, while others apply a free-of-charge or discount policy to 
all certification candidates.246
When national and European certification schemes are approved, they 
will be divided between comprehensive GDPR schemes, covering the full 
breadth of the GDPR; and single-issue schemes, focusing on particular 
GDPR sub-topics (e.g. data protection by design, child consent, etc.).247
For SMEs, certifications covering all facets of the GDPR may be easier and 
more cost-eff  ective than single-issue schemes, but it has to be borne 
in mind that all certifications have limited validity. Certifications have to 
be subject to revision when the legal framework of the jurisdiction they 
refer to is amended, terms and provisions are interpreted by judgements 
of the European Court of Justice, or current technical capabilities 
evolve.248 In fact, the GDPR sets a limit of the validity of a certification 
at 3 years.

4. SMEs and employees’ data
1514. SMEs and employees’ data
From a data protection point of view, in an employment relationship, the 
employer plays the role of the data controller, whereas the employee is 
the data subject.
Many activities routinely performed in the employment context entail 
the processing of workers’ personal data, some of which belongs to the 
special categories of personal data as listed in Article 9 of the GDPR 
(e.g. trade union membership, health-related information). Processing 
employees’ personal data is one of the most common data processing 
activities conducted by SMEs.
EXAMPLES
Personal data processing at work may include the following activities: 
reviewing application forms and work references; compiling payrolls; 
sharing employees’ data with competent authorities for tax or social 
benefits purposes; keeping records of sickness, annual leave, unpaid 
leave and special leave, and related appraisal forms; maintaining 
records relating to promoting, transfer, training and disciplinary 
matters; maintaining a registry related to workplace accidents.
It is worth noting that monitoring of emails, calls and workspaces for 
security purposes does involve the processing of personal data of 
employees.249
249 Article 29 Working Party, ‘Opinion on the processing of personal data in the employment 
context’ (13 September 2001) https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/
opinion-recommendation/files/2001/wp48sum_en.pdf  1.
4. Specific personal data processing context
152The GDPR allows Member States to specify rules for personal data 
processing in the employment context. Member States are entitled 
to adopt rules concerning e.g. employees’ consent, the recruitment 
process, and the implementation of employment contracts.250
SUGGESTION
Considering that a Member State’s rules governing personal 
data processing in the employment context may diff  er, SMEs are 
recommended to consult the national implementing rules of the GDPR 
and the guidance issued by their DPA.
4.1. What are the possible legal bases 
for processing the personal data of 
employees?
Similar to other processing operations, to process the personal data 
of their employees, SMEs need a legal basis.251 In general, the use 
consent for the processing of personal data in the employment context 
is not appropriate for this purpose: the economic and power imbalance 
between employer and employees make it diffi   cult for employees to 
provide consent that would be considered ‘free’.252 Reliance on consent 
should be confined to cases where the worker has a genuine free choice 
and is subsequently able to withdraw consent without detriment.253
250 Article 88 GDPR and Recital 155.
251 See 2.4 What are the possible legal bases for personal data processing?
252 Footnote 30, 330.
253 Article 29 Working Party, ‘Opinion on the processing of personal data in 
the employment context’ (2001) https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/
documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2001/wp48sum_en.pdf 2.
4. SMEs and employees’ data
153The more appropriate legal bases could be: 
»the performance of a contract to which the employee is party. 
EXAMPLE
The employer must meet obligations under the employment contract, 
such as pay the employee.254
»the compliance with a legal obligation to which the employer is subject. 
EXAMPLES
There are situations where the employer must communicate personal 
data of the employee for social security, welfare, or tax purposes.
Another example of this could be a situation, where the employer is 
legally obliged to obtain a certificate of good conduct of (prospective) 
employees, or check their qualifications.
»the legitimate interest of the employer, insofar it is not overridden by 
the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of a data subject. 
EXAMPLES
A recruiter browses a publicly available database (e.g. LinkedIn or 
similar) and contacts a person to off  er a job interview. An estate agent 
communicates to a client the contact details of one of their workers to 
schedule an appointment.

id=610169  7.
4. Specific personal data processing context
1544.2. When and what monitoring activities 
are permissible? 
Modern technologies enable employees to be tracked over time, across 
workplaces and their homes, through many diff  erent devices such as 
smartphones, desktops, tablets, vehicles, and wearables.255
Monitoring activities are forms of personal data processing that can 
occur during the recruitment process (e.g. if an employer checks data 
of aspirant employees on social media), for the length of the contractual 
relationship (e.g. video surveillance, GPS on vehicles used by employees) 
and even after the end of the working relationship (e.g. if an employer 
monitors former employees’ LinkedIn profiles to ensure that they are 
not infringing a non-competition clause).256
In certain situations, the employer may be legally obliged to perform 
certain forms of tracking (e.g. install tracking technologies in vehicles to 
be sure that a driver does not exceed a certain number of driving hours 
per day).
In other cases, the employers may have a legitimate interest in 
monitoring employees (e.g. for security reasons; for safety reasons; 
to prove unlawful conduct of an employee). However, monitoring 
employees poses risks from a fundamental rights perspective. 
Systematic or occasional monitoring can infringe upon the privacy rights 
of an employee, and limit employees’ channels by which they could 
inform employers about irregularities or illegal actions of superiors and/
or colleagues threatening to damage the business or workplace.257
255 Ibid.
256 Ibid.
257 Ibid.
4. SMEs and employees’ data
155EXAMPLE
An employer, who seeks to install a GPS in a company car to control 
the progress and circumstances of work of the employees, may invoke 
the legitimate interest as a legal basis. 
However, the employer must first evaluate whether the data 
processing is necessary for the purposes designated, and whether its 
implementation by a GPS device is proportionate to the limitations 
imposed on the rights of the employees. 
Employers must inform their employees of the installation of tracking 
devices in the company cars and must make clear that, while the 
employees use the vehicle, their movements are recorded.
The situation would be diff  erent if the employees were allowed to use 
company cars for private purposes, too. In this case, the employer 
could not invoke the legitimate interest because the implementation 
of a GPS device that would track a company car at all times would be 
disproportionate.
SUGGESTION
Whilst there are national diff  erences concerning whether an employer 
can monitor their employees, the common traits are that: 
»policies and rules concerning legitimate monitoring must be clear 
and readily accessible, ideally elaborated by the employer together 
with the representatives of the employees; and 
»privacy-friendly organizational solutions have to be preferred to 
the monitoring of the employees. For example, an employer may 
opt for the introduction of filters upon websites accessible from 
the workplace rather than monitoring all the web activities of the 
employees. Consider what other options are available to achieve the 
same goal.
Annex I – National lawsAnnex I – National laws
The General Data Protection Regulation replaced the Data Protection 
Directive on 25 May 2018. While it harmonized data protection rules and 
became ‘directly applicable’ across the EU/EEA, some diff  erences remain 
among national laws specifying data protection rules. For this reason, 
when adhering to data protection rules, national laws implementing the 
GDPR must be consulted. Below is an overview of such laws, prepared
