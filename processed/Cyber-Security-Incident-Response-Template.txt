Incident Response P lan  <Version #> Goals for Cyber Incident Response  
When  a cyber security incident  occurs , timely and thorough action to manage the impact of the  incident  
is a critical to an effective  response process. The response should limit the potential for damage by  
ensuring that actions are well known and coordinated.  Specifically, the response goals are:  
1. Preserve and protect the confidentiality  of constituent  and employee  information and  ensure the  
integrity and availability of <COMPANY NAME>  systems, net works and related data.  
 
2. Help <COMPANY NAME>  personnel recover their business processes after a computer or 
network  security incident or other t ype of data breach.  
 
3. Provide a consistent response strategy to system and network threats that p ut <COMPANY 
NAME > data and systems at risk.  
 
4. Develop and activate a communications plan including initial re porting of the incident as well as 
ongoing communications , as necessary.  
 
5. Address cyber related legal issues.  
 
6. Coordinate efforts with external Computer Incident Response Teams  and law enforcement . 
 
7. Minimize <COMPANY NAME> ’s reputational risk.  
 
Purpose and Scope  
This publication provides practical guidelines on responding to cyber security and data breach incidents 
in a consistent  and effective manner. The plan establishes a team of first responders to  an incident with 
defined roles, responsibilities, and means of  communication.  
While this plan is primarily oriented around cyber -related incidents and breaches, it can also be utilized 
for data breaches that are not related to computer systems.  
 
Incident Response Team ( IRT) 
A team comprised of company staff, advisors , and service providers shall be responsible for 
coordinating incident responses and  known as the Incident Response Team (IRT).  The IRT shall 
consist of the individuals listed in Appendix  A, having the noted roles and responsibilities.  This team 
will have both primary  members and secondary  members.  The primary members of the IRT  will act as 
first responders  or informed members  to an incident  that warrant IRT involvement , according to the 
incident’s  severity .  The entire IRT would be informed and involved in the most severe incidents.  
IRT members may take on additional roles during an incident, as needed.  Contact information, 
including a primary and secondary email address, plus office a nd mobile telephone numbers shall be 
maintained and circulated to the team.  The IRT will draw upon additional staff, consultants or other 
resources, (often referred to as Subject Matter Experts – SME’s)  as needed, for the analysis, 
remediation, and recovery process es of an incident.   The Information Technology (IT) function plays a 
<Company Logo>   Cyber Security Incident Response Plan  
  
 
Cyber Security  Page 3 of 12 <Date>  
Incident Response P lan  <Version #> significant role in the technical details that may be involved in an incident detection and response and 
can be considered an SME in that regard.  
There sh all be a member of the IRT designated as the Incident Response Manager (IRM), who will take 
on organizational and coordination roles of the IRT during an incident where the IRT is activated for 
response to the incident.  
 
Incident Response Life Cycle Proces s 
 
Cyber incident response  management  is an on -going process with a cyclical pattern.  The specific 
incident response process elements that comprise the Cyber Incident Response Plan include:  
 
1. Preparation:  The o n-going process of m aintaining and improving incident response capabilities 
and preventing incidents by ensu ring that systems, networks, applications , and data handling  
processes  are sufficiently secure, and employee awareness training is in place.  Practice 
exercises (aka Table -top Exercis es) for the IRT are conducted periodically , where various 
incident scenarios are presented to the Team in a practice session.  
 
2. Identification:  The process of c onfirming, characterizing, classifying, categorizing, scoping, and 
prioritizing suspected incidents.  
 
3. Notification:  Alerting IRT members to the occurrence of an incident  and communicating 
throughout the incident.  
 
4. Containment:  Minimizing financial and/or reputational loss, theft of information, or service 
disruption.   Initial c ommunic ation with constituents and news media, as required.  
 
5. Eradication:  Eliminating the threat.  
 
6. Recovery:  Restoring computin g services  to a normal state of operation  and the resumption of 
business activities  quickly and securely . Provide reputational repair measures and news media 
updates, if needed.  Provide credit monitoring services to effected constituents, or other 
remediation measures, as appropriate.  
 
7. Post -incident Activities:  Assessing the overall response effectiveness and identify ing 
opportunities for improvement  through , ‘lessons l earned ’ or mitigation of exploited weaknesses .  
Incorporation of incident’s learnings into the cyber fortification efforts and the response plan, as 
appropriate.  
 
These process elements are depicted in Figure 1, showing the closed loop nature of the process , in 
that the learnings from any prior incide nts are  used to improve the prevention and response process of 
potential future incidents.

Incident Occurrence & Awareness  
The way an incident becomes know will have an impact on the response process and its urgency.  
Examples by which <COMPANY NAME>  becomes aware of an incident include, but are not limited to 
the following:  
1. <COMPANY NAME>  discovers through its internal monito ring that a cyber incident or data 
breach has occurred.  
 
2. <COMPANY NAME>  is notified by one of its technology providers of an incident or  becomes 
aware of the same.  
3. <COMPANY NAME>  is made aware of a breach through  a constituent or  a third -party 
informant.  
4. <COMPANY NAME>  and the public are made aware of the incident through the news media.

13. Apply learnings to future preparedness.  IRT 
  
Communication Methods  
Company communication resources (email, phone system, etc.) may be compromised during a 
severe incident.  Primary and alternate methods of communication using external infrastructure 
will be established and noted on the IRT member contact list to provide s pecific methods of 
<Company Logo>   Cyber Security Incident Response Plan  
  
 
Cyber Security  Page 6 of 12 <Date>  
Incident Response P lan  <Version #> communication during an incident .  The IRT and any other individuals involved in an incident 
resolution will be directed as to which  communication method will be used during the  incident  
 
Information Recording  
Information recording is ve ry important during an incident, not only for effective containment and 
eradication efforts, but also for post -incident lessons learned , as well as any legal action that may 
ensue against the perpetrators .  Each member of the IRT shall be responsible for recording information 
and chronological references about their actions and findings during an incident , using the IRT Incident 
Record Form in Appendix E. 
 
Incident Response Exercises  
The IRT should conduct ‘table -top’ exercises to practice the response process  on a periodic 
basis, but at least annually , so all members of the IRT are familiar with the activities that would 
occur during an actual incident  and their related responsibilities .  The exercises may provide 
the opportunity for enhancing  the coordination and communication  among team members.   
 
Summary  
No perfect script can be written for the detailed activity encountered and decisions that will need to be 
made during an inciden t, as each incident will have its own uniqueness.  This plan shall serve as a 
framework for managing cyber security and data breach incidents, allowing the details of confirmation, 
containment, eradication , and communication  to be tailored  to fit the specific situation .
