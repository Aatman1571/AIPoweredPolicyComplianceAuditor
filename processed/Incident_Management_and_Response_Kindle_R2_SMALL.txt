Section	1.  Prepar e	
	
Incidents	happen	to	us	every	day.		We	forget	our	password.		One	of	our	kids	
forgets	their	lunch.		Our	computer	decides	not	to	print.		These	are	all	small	events	
that	hinder	our	ability	to	move	forward	in	our	day.		Security	incidents	are	the	same	
but	usually	have	a	greater	impact.	
	
A	security	incident	is	defined	differently	by	various	organizations.		NIST	
defines	an	incident	as	“A	violation	or	imminent	threat	of	violation	of	computer	security	policies,	acceptable	use	policies,	or	standard	security	practices”	 (Cichonski,	
Millar,	Grance,	&	Scarfone,	2012,	p.	6) .		I	find	this	too	narrow.			
	In	my	experience,	a	security	incident	is	an	event,	intentional	or	unintentional,	
that	occurs	outside	what	is	expected	in	daily	operations	that	can	negatively	affect	business	operation	(pr ocesses),	customers,	investors,	and	employees.		This	expands	
the	NIST	definition	by	including	anything	that	violates	policy,	regulations,	laws,	or	
ethics.	
	
In	other	words,	an	incident	is	anything	that	can	compromise	the	
confidentiality ,	integrity,	or	availability 	(CIA)	of	data	or	the	 systems	that	support	
business	processes.		Confidentiality	allows	only	authorized	individuals	or	
applications	access	to	sensitive	information.		Integrity	is	the	measure	of	the	data’s	
accuracy 	and	authenticity.		Availability	ensures	information	is	available	to	
authorized	entities	when	and	where	needed	for	business	operation. 	
	Incident	response	is	a	subset	of	an	overall	incident	management	program.		
The	purpose	of	incident	 management	is	to	prepare	for	various	types	of	incidents	
and	then	respond	when	they	oc cur.		Incident	management	has	four	goals:	
	
1. Development	and	management	of	an	incident	management	policy	and	supporting	procedures 	(details	in	Section	3)	
2. Creation,	training,	and	management	of	an	incident	response	team	
(details	in	Section	4)	
3. Preparation	
a. Strategic	Threat	intelligence	
b. Vulnerability	management	
c. Risk	management	(details	in	Section	2)	
4. Incident	response	to	reduce	or	prevent	business	impact	(details	in	
Section	5) 	
	
Section	1.01  Policy,	Procedures,	 and	Team	
The	incident	management	policy	forms	the	foundation	for	your	
organization’s	ability	to	prepare	for	and	respond	to	the	unwanted	and	unexpected.		
	An	incident	management	policy	template	is	available	for	downloa d	at	
http://bit.ly/2tTSKsg .		The	policy	should	create	an	incident	management	program	
and	assign	responsibilities	for	incident	management	and	response.	
	
In	Section 	3,	I	address 	creating	the	incident	response	team,	plan,	and	
procedures.		For	now,	it	is	enough	to	understand	the	need	for	documented	and	up-
to-date	incident	response	procedures.		You	never	want	to	face	an	incident	without	a	
clear	approach	to	mitigating	or	preventing	negative	business	impact.	
	
Section	1.02  Strategic	 Threat	Intelligence 	
Strategic	threat	intelligence	(STI)	provides	your	organization	with	
information	about	probable	threats	and	associated	tools	and	techniques	used	by	the	
threat	agents.		A	threat	agent	is	a	specific	incident	of	a	threat.		For	example,	a	threat	
is	potential	for	the	 theft	of	customer	payment	information	by	exploiting	
vulnerabilities .		A	threat	agent	would	be	a	specific	cybercriminal	using	certain	tools	
and	techniques	to	exploit	weaknesses	in	your	network	to	steal	the	information.			
	
Without	 understanding	 how	you	might	be	attacked,	it	is	impossible	to	
perform	comprehensive	risk	assessments.		Information	about	potential	threats	and	
threat	agents	is	available	from		
	
• Government	and	public	sources	
o US-CERT	Alerts	(http://bit.ly/2pUj5oY )	
o The	CyberWire	(https://thecyberwire.com/)	
o Threat	brief	( http://threatbrief.com/)	
o Twitter	feed s	of	top	security	professionals	
(http://bit.ly/2pWCG7u)	
• Your	vendors 	
o IPS	vendor 	
o SIEM	vendor 	
o Threat	analytics	vendor 	
o Microsoft 	
o Apple	
	
Section	1.03  Vulnerability	Management 	
Managing	vulnerabilities	is	ongoing.		It	allows	us	to	identify	and	assess	risk	
when	associated	with	relevant	 threat	agents.		For	example,	we	discover	missing	a	
patch	during	a	vulnerability	scan	for	Microsoft	Windows	that	is	currently	exploited	by	one	or	more	threat	agents.		Another	example	might	be	failing	to	block	all	
nonessential	SQL	Ser verÒ	traffic	passing	through	a	firewall	 or	by	unsecure	
configuration	of	VLAN	access	control	lists.		Vulnerabilities 	are	usually	caused	by	 	
	
• Unsecure	configuration	of	operating	systems,	network	devices,	and	
applications	
• Unsecure	coding	practices	or	developer	mistakes	
	• Lack	of	user	training	and	awareness 	
• Insufficient	attention	to	authentication,	authorization,	and	
accountability	in	access	controls 	
	
(a) Unsecure	Configuration	and	Coding	
Operating	systems,	such	as	WindowsÒ	and	Windows	Server Ò,	have	security	
baselines	provided	by	Microsoft	(http://bit.ly/2vcW6ML ).	Following	these	
baselines	is	a	good	start.		 Network	device	vendors	also	provide	guidance	on	how	to 	
securely	configure	their	products.		This	guidance	is	also	supported	by	security	best	
practices,	such	as	blocking	everything	on	a	firewall	and	opening	only	what	is	
necessary	for	business	operation. 		Cisco	provides	detailed	information	about	
hardening	IOS	devices	at	https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html.	
	
Securely	configuring	applications	 and	reviewing	coding	practices	 should	not	
cause	major	concerns,	if	the	System/Software	Development	Life	Cycle	(SDLC)	
minimally	includes	risk	assessments	and	security	requirements	testing.		For	
detailed	information	about	integrating	security	into	the	SDLC,	see	NIST	SP	800-64	R2	Security	Considerations	in	the	System	Development	Life	Cycle	(http://bit.ly/2kxni2y) .	
	
(b) Training	and	Awareness	
Humans	are	the	biggest	vulnerability	you	face.		Relying	on	user	behavior	to	
maintain	confidentiality,	integrity,	and	availability	is	a	control	of	last	resort:	a	
control	on	which	you	should	rely	 only	when	reasonable	and	appropriate	technology	
controls	leave	gaps.		Training	and	awareness	activities,	starting	with	a	strong	and	
communicated	Acceptable	Use	Policy	(download	policy	 template	from	
http://bit.ly/2pUtdOx),	help	to	manage	human	vulnerabilities.		For	detailed	
information	about	developing	and	managing	security	training	and	awareness	in	
your	organization,	see	NIST	SP	800-50	Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program (http://bit.ly/2qNzgII). 
 
(c) Access	C ontrol	
Controlling	access	to	information	resources	is	not	easy.		It	requires	
reasonable	and	appropriate	verification	of	any	person	or	application 	attempting	to	
access	a	resource	(authentication ).		(The	entity	attempting	to	access	a	resource	is	
called	the	subject ,	and	the	resource	being	accessed	is	called	the	object .)		This	is	
followed	by	authorization 	based	 on	analysis	of	user	roles	to	properly	apply	
segregation	of	duties,	need -to-know,	and	least	pri vilege.			
	
Segregation	of	duties	prevents	any	single	person	from	performing	all	tasks	
associated	with	a	business	process.		Need -to-know	ensures	 a	person	assigned	a 	
business	role	only	can	see	the	information	necessary	to	perform	related	tasks.		Least	privilege 	limits	what	users	in	a	role	can	do	with	data	they	access.		Here	is	an	
example…		
	1. A	user	logs	into	the	network	and	his/her	identity	is	established	
(authentication) 	
2. The	user	is	gra nted	access	to	the	payroll	system	because	of	his/her	
role	(course	authorization)	
3. The	user	is	granted	access	to	specific	tasks	or	data	within	the	application,	based	on	his/her	role	in	the	organization	(fine	authori zation	based	on	 segregation	of	duties)	
4. Once	the	user	selects	a	specific	task,	he	or	she	is	only	allowed	to	perform	specific	actions	on	the	data	(least	privilege)	
5. Database	limits	what	the	user	sees	to	only	what	is	necessary 	to	
perform	an	assigned	task	(need-to -know)	
	
The	final	component	of	access	control	is	accountability.		Accountability	
ensures	you	understand	what	subject	access ed	an	object,	what	was	done	to	the	
object,	and	when	the	action	happened.		Collection	of 	logs	and	log	auditing	is	the	
foundation	of	accountability. 	
	
The	strength	of	access	control	depends	on	the	 sensitivity	of	the	resource	
protected:	the	resource’s	classification.		We	classify	data	based	on	its	value	to	the	organization 	and	the	negative	impact	on	the	organization	if	the	CIA	of	that	data	is	
compromised.		For	example,	we	might	classify	data	as	
	
• Public:	anyone	can	access	and	see	the	information	with	no	negative	
impact	on	the	business	
• Confidential :	moderate	damage	to	the	organization	will	occur	if	the	
data’s	confidentiality,	integrity,	or	availability	is	compromised	
• Restricted:	severe	damage	to	the	organization	will	occur	if	the	data’s	confidentiality,	integrity,	or	availability	is	compromised	
	
Any	device	through	which	data	passes,	is	stored,	or	is	processed	is	given	the	
classification	associated	with	the	 most	sensitive	classification	of	data	involved.		If,	
for	example,	a	server	contains	restricted	and	public	data	(which	is	never	a	good	idea),	the	server	is	classified	as	re stricted.			You	should	consider	strong	access	
control	(multifactor	authentication	and	encryption)	for	critical	resources.				
	For	a	detailed	discussion	of	access	control,	see	 Identity	Management	and	
Access	Control	(http://bit.ly/2q0unas).		Download	the	University	System	of	Georgia	
segregation	of	duties	matrix	template	from	http://bit.ly/2pXCeGF	as	sample	tool	for	
planning	roles.	
	
(d) Vulnerability	Identification	
You	must	know	if	you	are	open	to	attack.		One	of	the	best	ways	to	do	this	is	
with	regular	vulnerability	scanning .		Nessus,	for	example,	is	an	up-to-date	tool	
widely	used	to	scan	networks	for	known	vulnerabilitie s.		A	vulnerability	
management	program	also	includes	penetration	testing	and 	third-party	security	
	program	reviews.		All	of	this	begins	with	a	vulnerability	management	policy	and	
associated	procedures	 (download	 policy	 template	from	http://bit.ly/2rjaikx) .	
	A	valuable	tool	for	knowing	what	vulnerabilities	you	potentially	have	in	
house	is	the	National	Vulnerability	Database	( https://nvd.nist.gov/ ).	
	
Section	1.04  Section	Summary	
The	purpose	of	incident	management	is	to	prepare	for	various	types	of	
incidents	and	then	to	respond	when	they	occur.		Incident	management	has	four	
goals: 	
	
1. Development	and	management	of	an	incident	management	policy	and	supporting	procedures	 	
2. Creation,	training,	and	management	of	an	incident	response	team		
3. Preparation	
4. Incident	response	to	reduce	or	prevent	business	impact		
	
A	security	incident 	is	an	event,	intentional	or	unintentional,	that	occurs	
outside	what	is	expected	in	daily	operations	that	can	negatively	affect	business	processes ,	customers,	investors,	and	employees.		It	is	anything	that	can	compromise	
the	confidenti ality,	integrity,	or	availability	of	data	or	systems	that	support	business	
processes
	2-1	Section	2.  Risk	Management 	
	
Managing	risk	is	the	first	step	in	information	assurance,	and	it	is	a	critical	
piece	of	incident	management.		In	both	cases,	risk	assessments	and	subsequent	risk	
acceptance,	avoidance,	transference,	or	mitigation	are	the	foundation	of	preventing	
and	responding	to	threa ts	agents .		If	the	incident	re sponse	team	does	not	run	the	
organization’s	information	risk	management	program,	its	members	should	at	least	be	involved	in	every	risk	assessment.		The	formulaic	risk	model	I	use	for	our	discussion	of	incide nt	management	related	to	human	attacks	is	shown	in	Figure	1.	
	
	
Figure	 1:	Risk	Model	
Section	1	explains	threats	and	vulnerabilities.		 In	Figure	1,	the	set	of	
vulnerabilities	available	to	enable	an	attack	are	categorized	as	opportun ity.		The	
probability	that	a	threat	agent	can	or	will	successfully	take	advantage	of	an	opportunity	to	reach	its	objective	is	a	key	component	of	risk.	Means	are	the	skills	necessary	to	successfully	reach	the	intended	target.		 A	human	threat	agent	is	usually	
motivated	by	the	financial,	political,	or	other	value	of	the	attack	target.	Natural	disasters	need	no	motivation.	
	
As	the	strength	and	tested	effectiveness	of	controls	increase,	means	and	
motivation	must	also	increase.		This	serves	to	shrink	the	number	of	possible	threat	agents;	probability	of	occurrence	for	human	attacks	tends	to	decrease.		This	
decrease	is	caused	by	the	increased	effort	(cost)	to	reach	the	target	and	the	decrease	in	return	on	investment	for	the	threat	agent.		Decrease	in	probability 	is	also	related	
to	the	difficulty	something	like	a	worm	would	have	spreading	across	your	organization	and	affecting	availability,	for	example.		If	a	threat	agent’s	motivation	is	high,	and	she	is	highly	skilled,	a	lower	but	still	present	probability	of	successful	
vulnerability	exploits	exists. 	
	
Once	a	threat	agent	gains	entry	to	your	network	or	one	of	your	systems,	
potential	for	negative	business	impact	arises.		 According	to	Gartner	(2017),	business	
impact	includes	“…the	potential	effects	(financial,	life/safety,	regulatory,	legal/contractual,	reputation	and	so	forth)	of	natural	and	man-made	events	on	
business	operations”	(para.	1) 	
	How	quickly	we	detect,	contain,	and	manage	an	attack 	affects	the	extent	of	
the	impact.		This	is	the	purpose	of	incident	response .		If	your	organization	has	a	
documented	incident	response	plan	and	a	trained	incident	response	team,	you	can	prevent	serious	harm	when	the	inevitable	intrusion	occurs.	
	

	As	with	all	security	activities,	risk	management	begins	with	a	management	
approved	and	supported	policy.		 Shon	Harris	provides	a	great	article	about	what	
goes	into	a	risk	management	policy	at	http://bit.ly/2q9BgHB.	
	
Section	2.01  Risk	 Assessments 	
Risk	management	helps	prevent	and	prepare	for	incidents. 		The	most	
valuable	tool	in	this	process	is	the	risk	assessment.		A	risk	assessment	looks	clo sely	
at	each	system ,	the	your	network,	and	other	organization s	where	your	data	is	stored	
or	processed.		 Perform	risk	assessments		
	
• During	the	initiation	and	development/acquisition	phases	of	the	SDLC	
(http://bit.ly/2kxni2y )	
• When	deemed	necessary	by	a	Change	Advisory	Board	(http://bit.ly/2f20um5)	
• When	new	vulnerabilities	are	discov ered	in	your	systems	or	network,	
or	when	announced	by	a	third-party	
• When	threat	intelligence 	reveals	a	new	threat,	threat	agent,	or	tools	
and	techniques	
• At	least	once	per	year	for	systems	touching	highly	sensitive	data	or	supporting	critical	business	processes 	
	
An	assessment	consists	of	10	steps	divided	into	two 	phases:	
	Phase	I:	Assess	
1. System	definition	
2. Threat	identification 		
3. Vulnerability	identification 	
4. Attack	path	controls	assessment	
5. Business	impact	analysis	
6. Risk	determination	
7. Controls	Recommendations	
Phase	II:	Manage	
8. Action	plan	and	proposal	creation	and	presentation	
9. Implement	approved	controls	or	transfer	risk	
10. Measure	to	ensure	steps	taken	work	as	expected	and	adjust	where	
necessary 	
	
(a) System	Definition	
System	definition	begins	with	system	decomposition.		System	decomposition	
breaks	down	a	system	into	the	various	components	of	its	attack	surface	(Olzak,	
2011).		A	system	is	the	collection	of	devices	and	media	used	to	access,	process,	store ,	
and	move	information	for	a	related	set	of	business	processes.		For	example,	the	
infrastructure	supporting	payroll	processes	is	the	payroll	system.		In	some	cases,	
you	might	want	to	assess	only	parts	of	the	system.		However,	you	should	assess	complete	systems	at	least	annually.	
		
A	system’s	attack	surface	is	not	a	single	piece.		Instead,	it	is	an	aggregate	of	
multiple	attack	surfaces.		Figure	2	shows	a	very	simple	model.		In	this	model,	the	network	attack	surface	can	be	further	broken	down	into	each	network	device	
(switches,	routers,	firewalls,	etc.)	and	cabling.		The	device	attack	surface	includes	
the	operating	system	and	applications	it	hosts.		I	placed	the	device	attack	surface	over	the	network	attack	surface	because	today’s	most	popular	and	destructive	
attacks	target	users	and	their	devices.		 	
	
	
Figure	 2:	Attack	Surface	
When	assessing	attack	surfaces,	consider	the	following 	(Olzak,	2017) 	
	
• Entry	points	where	the	system	receives	information.	
• Exit	points	where	the	system	provides	information	to	other	systems:	
o Direct	exit	points	exchange	information	with	external	systems.	
o Indirect	exit	points	provi de	information	to	direct	exit	points.	
• Data	channels,	 protocol -enabled	pathways	over	which	information	
travels.	
• Untrusted	data	items,	persistent	entities	attackers	use	to	control	
systems	or	extract	data.		Examples	include	cookies,	files,	malicious	
database	 records,	and	registry	entries.		Attackers	cause	exit	points	to	
read	from	untrusted	data	items	or	use	entry	points	to	write	into	
untrusted	data	items	(Manadhata,	Karabulat,	&	Wing,	n.d.) .		They	are	
used	by	threat	agents	to	own	a	device	or	system.	
	Protecting	information	transit	points	and	channels;	and	defending	against	
untrusted	data	items	requires	strong	access	rights	between	 subjects	and	objects .		
See	Figure	3.	
	

		
Figure	 3:	Access	Rights	
	
Any	access	between	an	object 	and	a	subject	should	be	controlled	with	consistent	
rights	management.		“Access	rights	identify	subjects,	the	objects	they	can	access,	and	what	they	can	do	after	access	is	granted”	(Ol zak,	2017).		This	does	not	just	apply	to	
users	and	the	resources	they	access;	it	also	applies	to	applications,	services,	protocols,	and	anything	else	that	attempts	to	access	an	object	for	any	reason.	
	
Information	about	the	system	or	network	assessed	can	come	from	several	
sources:	
	
• Existing	documentation	
• Interviews 	
• Questionnaires 	
• Network	scans 	
	
(b) Identify	Existing	Controls	
Identify	existing	controls 	and	potential	vulnerabilities 	by	walking	through	
probable	attack	paths	using	network	and	data	flow	diagrams	to	create	attack	trees.		
An	attack	tree	helps	visualize	how	a	threat	agent	might	gain	access	to	an	intended	
target.		Figure	4	shows	an 	attack	tree	with	a	database	server	as	the	target.		This	
example	does	not	show	all	possible	attack	paths. 		For	a	detailed	description	of	how	
to	use	an	attack	tree,	including	addressing	probability	of	successful	attacks,	see	Risk	Management	(http://bit.ly/2rCPNM7 ).	
	
	

		
Figure	 4:	Attack	Tree 	
	
In	addition	to	attack	trees,	I	recommend	creating	a	controls	matrix.		A	
controls	matrix	lists	all	controls	implemented,	how	they	are	configured,	and	what	
they	protect.		Figure	5	is	a	screen	shot	of 	a	controls	matrix	template	you	can	
download	from	http://bit.ly/2pVWAV3.		See	 Use	a	security	controls	matrix	to	justify	
controls	and	reduce	costs	(http://tek.io/2pWwnFA)	for	a	detailed	explanation	on	
how	to	use	the	matrix.

(c) Business	Impact	Analysis	(BIA)	and	Calculating	Risk	
Use	a	BIA 	to	determine	the	severity	of	the	negative	impact	on	a	business	if	an	
incident	occurs.		Many	variables	affect	business	impact,	including	(Olzak,	2012) 	
	
• Maximum	tolerable	downtime	(http://tek.io/2rDmgC5)	
• Impact	on	employees	
• Impact	on	investors	
• Impact	on	customers	
• Impact	on	current	and	future	earnings	potential	
• Sanctions	due	to	non -compliance	with	regulatory	requirements	
	
A	BIA	can	be	qualitative	or	quantitative.		How	you	approach	the	BIA	affects	
how	you	approach	an	overall	risk	assessment.		A	quantitative	assessment	uses	
actual	dollar	amounts	to	estimate	business	impact.		A	qualitative	assessment	uses	
some	type	of	scale	to	estimate	damage.		Hybrid	analysis	is	a	combination	of	the	
quantitative	and	qualitative	approaches.		 A	qualitative	risk	calculator,	downloadable	
from	http://bit.ly/2pYNh6r ,	is	shown	in 	Figure	6.		This	calculator	is	just	one	
approach	to	qualitative	assessments,	which	are	educated	guesses	based	on	experience	and	collaboration.		 For	a	detailed	discussion	of	risk	assessments,	see	Risk	
Management	(http://bit.ly/2rCPNM7 ).	
	If	you	choose	to	download	the	calculator,	the	 System	Sensitivity	cells	are	
linked	to	a	worksheet	that	calculates	this	value.		The	yellow	column	also	contains	a	formula.		Other	worksheets	provide	guidelines	for	 scoring 	the	other	columns.		
Change	these	to	conform	to	your	business	operations,	security	framework,	and	
management’s	appetite	for	risk.		And	remember,	a	threat	agent	usually	must	bypass	
two	or	more	vulnerabilities	to	reach	the	target.			
	
	

		
Figure	 6:	Qualitative	Risk	Calculator 	
	
Approaches	to	performing	a	BIA	differ	between	organizations.		However,	we	
must	always	focus	on	the	same	things	regardless	of	how	our	procedures	look.		
According	to	Ross	(2010),	avoid	the	following	10	BIA	mistakes:	
	
1. Considering	the	impact	of	interrupted	applications,	not	business	processes.		Remember,	the	impact	is	to	business	operations	if	a	
system	is	not	available	due	to	compromise	or	failure.		Unavailability	
impacts	business	processes	that	feed	and	use	the	failed	system.		If	you	take	your	order	entry	system	offline	because	of	an	attack,	for	example,	
no	product	ships.		Customers	are	not	happy,	and	revenue	is	lost. 	
2. Considering	applications	in	isolation .		Again,	few	applications	
operate	in	isolation.		Most	share	information	with	other	applications	
that	enable	multiple	business	processes.		When	performing	a	BIA	for	a	system	or	a	network	device,	look	at	all	affected	 systems	and	related	
processes.			
3. Paying	too	little	attention	to	financial 	impact .		Financial	impact	is	a	
measure	of	how	an	incident	affects	your	organization’s	bottom	line	on	a	profit	and	loss	statement.		This	includes	all	costs,	including		
	
a. Loss	of	short	term	revenue	
b. Regulatory	fines 	
c. Civil	action	by	customers,	shareholders,	etc.	
d. Identity	theft	management	
e. Cost	of	recovery 	
f. etc.	
	

	Costs	associated	with	an	 incident	must	be	calculated	with	the	help	of	
all	affected	areas	of	the	business.		This	is	necessary	even	if	you	use	a	
qualitative	or	hybrid	approach	to	your	analysis.	
4. Paying	too	much	attention	to	financial	impact.		In	addition	to	hard	dollar	costs,	other	 costs	affect	the	long -term	health	of	a	business	
following	an	incident,	including	loss	of	reputation	and	customer	
confidence;	and	loss	of	competitive	advantage,	especially	when	
intellectual	property	is	involved.	
5. Failing	to	distinguish	enterprise	applications.		Applications	that	
serve	the	entire	organization	fall	into	this	category.		Examples	include	
legal	and	document	management	systems.	
6. Failing	to	recognize	data	center	applications.		Systems/solutions	only	used	by	IT	are	often	ignored	during	risk	assessments.		Be	sure	
you	include	these	in	your	assessments.	
7. Confusing	a	risk	assessment	with	a	BIA.		A	BIA	is	a	subset	of	a	risk	
assessment,	but	it	can	stand	on	its	own.		Even	if	you	have	no	idea	what	
might	cause	the	unavailability	of	a	system	or	business	process,	a	BIA	is	something	to	consider:	at	least	to	establish	value	to	the	
organization.	
8. Confusing	risk	acceptance	with	a	business	impact	analysis.		Do	not	allow	business	managers	to	simply	accept	risk	because	they	do	
not	want	to	spend	the	time	working	with	you	to	create	a	BIA.		This	is	one	more	instance	where	support	of	C-level	management	for	incident	
management	is	irreplaceable.	
9. Pre-determining	BIA	results.		Ross	writes	that 	a	business	manager	
can	correctly	estimate	loss	without	a	formal	BIA	about	80	percent	of	
the	time.		This	is	the	same	as	saying	that	one	in	five	business	processes	or	applications	is	inaccurately	analyzed.		Even	when	
pursuing	a	qualitative	analysis,	it	is	important	to	take	time	to	walk	
through	 estimated	costs.	
10. Backing	into	a	BIA	result.		Sometimes,	managers	choose	to	
understate	the	financial,	reputational,	and	operational	impact	of	an	
incident	because	the	perceived	impact	is	too	high.		This	undermines	
the	ability	to	effectively	prepare	for	and	manage	incidents.	
	
(d) Risk	Management	Recommendations	
How	you	manage	risk	is	largely	determined	by	management’s	risk	appetite:	
the	level	of	risk	 managers	are	willing	to	assume	to	achieve	business	objectives.		Part	
of	creating	an	incident	management	program	is	meeting	with	the	organization’s	
business	risk	management	team	or	senior	management	to	understand	acceptable	
levels	of	risk.		This	helps	provide	workable	recommendations	at	this	point	in	the	
risk	assessment.	
	
Once	we	know	the	risk,	recommend	one	of	the	following:	
	
	• Accept	the	risk.		If	the	cost	of	the	risk	is	lower	than	any	mitigation	or	
transfer	solutions	available,	we	usually 	recommend	risk	acceptance.	
• Mitigate	the	risk.		If	the	cost	of	risk	is	higher	than	the	cost	of	mitigation	solutions,	we	usually	recommend	mitigation.		
Recommending	mitigation	requires	a	detailed	analysis	of	our	existing	controls	to	determine	if	they	can	be	reconfigured	to	reduce	risk.		It	
also	requires	analysis	regarding	how	we	might	use	fewer	new	
controls	by	integrating	them	into	the	existing	framework.		In	other	
words,	never	simply	throw	new	controls	at	risk	without	a	thorough	
analysis	of	what	you	have	and	what	you	need .		Finally,	any	controls	we	
recommend	should	be	reasonable	and	appropriate	for	business	
operation.	
• Transfer	the	risk.		Transferring	risk	typically	means	purchasing	incident	loss	insurance.		Many	insurance	carriers	now	offer	this.		
Purchasing	insurance	might	be	something	done	in	addition	to	mitigation.		For	example,	you	might	purchase	insurance	to	cover	costs	
associated	with	customer	identity	theft	protection	in	addition	to	
implementing	additional	technical	controls.		Together,	transference	
and	mitigation	work	to	reduce	risk	to	acceptable	levels.	
• Avoid	the	risk.		Sometimes,	risk	is	avoided	by	simply	not	doing	something	by	removing	existing	procedures/technology	or	by	not	
implementing	a	new	solution.		In	my	years	as	a	director	of	security,	management	chose	to	avoid	risk	only	once.		Never	count	on	
avoidance.		Our	job	as	security	professionals	is	to	find	ways	to	safely	
enable	solutions	that	management	deems	necessary	to	reach	the	
organization ’s	objectives.	
	
(e) Results	Documentation	and	Presentation	
Provide	detailed	documentation	for	how	you	conducted	the	assessment	and	
your	results.		The	details	help	 the	risk	mitigation	team	be	more	effective.		The	NIST	
Risk	Management	Guide	for	Information	Technology	Systems,	SP	800 -30	
(http://bit.ly/2rLdVfJ )	provides	an	excellent	template.		However,	details	are	
something	management	usually	does	not	care	about.		They	only	want	to 	see	the	
risks	and	what	you	believe	needs	to	be	done	to	manage	the	risks.			
	
In	addition	to	a	detailed	assessment	document	and	a	technical	presentation,	
create	a	presentation	for	management.		This	presentation	provides	a	high-level	
explanation	of	what	you	did	and	the	risks	discovered.		At	the	opening	of	the	
presentation,	let	the	attendees	know	you	want	them	to	decide	on	your	
recommendations.		Be	clear	about	how	your	recommendations	are	financially	and	operationally	 reasonable	and	appropriate. 	
	The	final	document	resulting	from	an	assessment	is	the	action	plan.		The	
action	plan	is	the	result	of	management’s	approval	of	your	recommendations.		It	
	includes	what	is	to	be	done,	who	is	responsible,	 and	status.		You	can	download	from	
http://bit.ly/2rtKAtT	the	template	I	use.	
	
Section	2.02  Section	Summary	
Incident	management	is	inseparable	from	risk	management.		In	addition	to	
creating	and	practicing	a	response	plan,	the	incident	management	team	should	be	
involved	in	every	risk	assessment.		In	my	opinion,	the	team	should	manage	the	
assessments	as	part	of	their	day-to -day	operations.	
	Risk	is	assessed	by	first	understanding	the	system	or	network	analyzed	and	
then	walking	through	all	potential	threat	paths.		This	should	occur	when	a	new	
threat	emerges	or	when	new	vulnerabilities	are	discovered.		In	any	case,	risk	
assessments	for	critical	systems	and	sensitive	data	should	happen	at	least	annually.	
	Your	risk	management	recommendations	must	be	reasonable	and	
appropriate	for	the	organization’s	budget	and	operations.		Management	must	see	
the	short -	and	long-term	financial	and	non-financial	impact	of	simply	accepting	risk:	
or	worse,	doing	nothing.		
	3-1	Section	3.  Team	Creation	and	 Planning 	
	
In	this	section,	I	walk	throug h	details	of	creating	and	managing	an	incident	
response	team	and	plan.		The	purpose	of	the	plan	is	to 	
	
• Rapidly	detect	anomalous	network,	system,	or	device	behavior	
(situational	awareness) 	
• Minimize	loss	and	destruction	
• Mitigate	exploited	weaknesses 	
• Restore	servic es	
• Gather	forensic	evidence	when	reasonable	and	appropriate 	
	
Carnegie	Mellon’s	incident	response	plan	is	a	good	start	for	any	organization.		
It	is	available	for	download	at	 http://bit.ly/2s7fCEn.	
	
Section	3.01  The	Team 	
Before	plann ing	starts,	you	need	an	incident	response	team.		As	I	wrote	in	
Section	2,	this	team	is	responsible	for	more	than	simply	responding	to	incidents.		It	has	a	role	in	all	risk	management,	incident	prevention,	and	incident	preparation	
activities.		Consequently, 	the	team	makeup	must	include	representatives	from	all	
technical	teams,	organization	operations	teams,	and	other	relevant	stakeholders.	
	
(a) Computer	Security	Incident	Response	Team	(CSIRT)	Membership	
The	following	list	of	team	members	is	general	and	only	a	start.		Each	
organization	is	unique,	and	the	makeup	of	the	team	depends	on	whom	must	be	
involved	to	ensure	effective	incident	management.	
	
• Incident	manager	
• Security	analyst	
• Computer	forensics	investigator	
• Server	engineer 	
• Network	engineer	
• Server	administrator	
• Network	administrator	
• Business	analyst	for	each	department/line	of	business	
• Software	developer 	
• Data	center	operator 	
• Inside	legal	counsel	
• Human	resources	
• Public	relations 	
	
	Depending	on	the	organization,	some	of	these	members	might	be	outside	
support	vendors.		All	CSIRT 	members	should	participate	in	preparation	and	
planning.	 	
	
These	team	members	serve	as	team	leads	in	their	respective	areas.		When	an	
incident	occurs,	you	will	likely	need	more	than	one	network	engineer,	for	example.		
Also,	consider	training	two	individuals	for	each	team	role:	a	primary	and	a	
secondary.		The	primary	might	not	always	be	available	during	an	incident .	
	
Identify	a	subset	of	the	team	as	your	initial	responders.		The	initial	response	
team,	including	an	on-call	responder,	perform	the	first	response	steps	as	described	later	in	this	section	and	in	Section	5 .	
	
One	set	of	members,	the	business	analysts,	act	as	bridges	between	the	 CSIRT 	
and	the	business	departments	and	lines	of	business.		In	larger	organizations,	these	
positions	already	exist,	providing	day-to -day	project	and	IT	support	functions	to	
ensure	technology	effectively	supports	each 	department,	lines	of	business,	and	
overall	tactical	and	strategic	objectives.		Business	analysis	are	often	missing	in	smaller	organizations.		In	such	cases,	a	representative	from	each	department	and	
each	line	of	business	is	a	necessary	alternative.		The	business	analyst	or	business	
representative	is	the	point	of	communication	between	the	CSIRT	and	the	business.		
This	is	an	irreplaceable	and	critical	part	of	planning,	preparation,	and	response.	
	
Once	an	incident	response	policy	creates	the	 CSIRT ,	the	team	begins	creating	
plans	and	procedures	to	meet	its	responsibilities. 			
	
(b) CSIRT	Responsibilities	
Many	people	believe	the	 CSIRT 	sits	around	waiting	for	the	next	incident.		 Not	
true.		The	incident	response	team	is	responsible	for	
	
• Risk	management.		As	shown	in	Section	2,	the	CSIRT	is	either	directly	
responsible	for	managing	information	resource	risk	or	provides	support	for	
those	who	are.		 	
• Incident	prevent ion	and	preparation.		Conducting	or	participating	in	
penetration	tests	and	vulnerability	management	is	a	good	start.		The	CSIRT 	
should	also	be	involved	in	the	change	management	process.		This	ensures	the	
risk	management	controls	and	procedures	identified	in	the	SDLC	and	risk	
assessments	are	maintained	in	a	way	that	supports	incident	management.	
• New	threat	and	vulnerability	advisory	distribution .		Threat	intelligence	
and	vulnerability	research	daily	reveal 	new	ways	attackers	try	to	attack	your	
organization.		The	CSIRT 	is	responsible	for	identifying	new	threats	and	
vulnerabilities,	performing	analysis	to	determine	associated	risk	to	the	
organization,	and	distributing	this	information	to	appropriate	IT	and	business	teams.	
	• Incident	detection	and	response.		 The	CSIRT 	is	responsible	for	monitoring	
for	and	assessing	anomalous	behavior	of	systems,	devices,	networks,	and	
users.		The	CSIRT 	declares	incidents	when	appropriate	and	executes	the	
incident	response	plan. 	
• Education	and	awareness.		 Educating	employees	about	the	importance	of	
safe	use	of	information	resources,	policy	compliance,	and	regulatory	
compliance	should	already	be	happening	with in	your	organization.		
However,	many	organizations	do	not	address	in	training	sessions	what	business	employees,	IT	staff,	and	managers	should	do	if	they	suspect	an	
incident	or	if	notified	of	one.		This	is	a	big	miss.		The	CSIRT 	should	manage	
security	training	and	awareness	or	be	directly	i nvolved	in	content	and	
delivery,	including	how	to	report	anomalous	behavior.	
• Information	sharing.		 Whether	an	attack	is	successful	or	not,	consider	
sharing	all	information	gathered	during	initial	and	incident	response	analysis	with	both	internal	and	external	entities,	including 	
	
o Stakeholders	
o Regional	and	state	law	enforcement	agencies	
o Federal	agencies 	
o Interest	and	industry	groups 	
	
In	addition	to	incident	information,	share	incident	management	findings	
about	threats,	risks,	and	other	incident	related.		This	allows	a	broad	defense	
against	threat	agents. 	
	
(c) CSIRT	Response	Tools	and	Resources	
Part	of	planning	and	preparing	is	putting	together	a	set	of	tools	and	
supporting	resources	that	enable	the	 CSIRT	when	an	incident	occurs,	including	a	
command	center;	jump	kit;	forensics	lab	(commonly	outsourced);	incident	response	
forms	with	documented	procedures	and	checklists;	and	external	resource	contacts.	
	
(i) Command	center	
When	an	incident	occurs	requiring	more	than	quick	eradication	and	
recovery,	the	CSIRT	will	gather	in	a	central	location	for	analysis,	information	sharing,	and	leadership.		This	command	center	is	usually	a	previously	designated	
conference	room	or	training	facility	with	minimally	
	
• Whiteboards	and 	markers	
• Speaker	phones 	
• Multiple	tables	for	team	and	sub-team	coordination	and	information	sharing	
• Hardwired	connection	to	the	internal	network 	
• Isolated	access	path	to	the	Internet	for	research,	support,	and	reporting 	
	
	The	command	center	is	the	central	point	of	response	communication	and	
operations.		It	is	where	the	team	and	others	will	find	the	incident	manager.		It	is	also	
where	all	incident	activity	coordination	and	logging	take	place.		 	
	
(ii) Jump	kit	
A	jump	kit	is	a	forensics	bag	of	tools	a	responder	can	quickly	grab	and	head	
out	the	door.		It	 should	contain 	everything	necessary	for	at	least	initial	response	
evidence	 preservation,	as	described	 in	Section	5 ,	including	
	
1. Journal	for	taking	notes	(who,	what,	when,	where,	how, 	and	why)	about	
every	facet	of	the	incident,	including	physical	access 	
2. Contact	list	for	all	CSIRT	members	and	external	support	 	
3. Up-to -date	antimalware	on	USB	drive	or	CD	
4. Crime	scene	tape	(http://amzn.to/2qgV1Nu)	
5. Duct 	tape	or	other	adhesive 	
6. Evidence	bags 	(http://amzn.to/2rUBqTE)	
7. Faraday	bags 	for	immediate	collection	of	cell	phones,	tablets,	and	other	
wireless	mobile	devices	(http://amzn.to/2qkFuuZ )	
8. Evidence	tags 	(http://amzn.to/2rAhwAK)	
9. Chain	of	custody	forms	(http://bit.ly/2qkzr9K)	
10. Digital	camera	with	extra	batteries 	
11. Sketch	book	with	pencils 	and	pencil	sharpener 	
12. A	laptop	with	an	industry	and	judicially	acceptable	(stands	up	in	court)	
forensics	solution,	such	as	EnCase	( http://bit.ly/1SRrdxM) 	
13. Hard	drive	duplicator	with	write -block	capabilities	
(http://amzn.to/2rAAJSX)	
14. Miscellaneous	cables,	connectors,	adaptors,	etc. 	
	
The	contents	of	you r	jump	kit	will	vary	from	this	list	depending	on	whether	
your	in-house	team	performs	detailed	forensics	activities	or	whether	you	outsource	
them.		At	the	very	least,	your	kit	should	contain	items	1	through	11	in	the	list	above.	
	
(iii) Forensics	lab	
Not	every	organization	needs	a	forensics	lab.		I	worked	for	a	large	
organization,	and	we	did	not	have	one.		Instead,	we	outsource d	forensics	analysis	
when	needed.		However,	I	provide	a	description	of	what	a	lab	should	include	for	
those	organizations	deciding	t o	retain	this	function	in	house.		You	can	also	use	this	
list	when	assessing	the	credibility	and	effectiveness	of	a	potential	forensics	vendor.	 	
	
• Strong	access	control	to	the	lab	that	minimally	includes	logging	authorized	
personnel	who	enter	and	when 	
• A	server	for	organizing	and	retaining	investigation	results	(not	connected	to	the	Internet)	
• A	lab	network	isolated	(preferably	air	gapped)	from	the	organization’s	network	with 	an	Internet 	connection	separate	from	the	rest	of	the	
	organization 	and	the	lab	administrative	network	(Internet	connection	should	
be	only	for	administrative	systems,	never	for	systems	used	for	evidence	
analysis	or	that	are	evidence	themselves)	
• Administrative	systems	for	Internet	access	and	lab	management	functions,	connected	to	a	network	isolated	from	analysis	systems	
• Systems	for	analysis 	(virtual	is	a	good	idea)	running	various	operating	
systems:		
o Windows	desktop	 	
o Windows	Server 	
o Mac	OS	
o Linux 	
• Drive	duplicators	with	write	blockers 	
• Readers	for	various	types	of	media	(e.g.,	SIMs	and	flash	memory)	
• Media	wiping	equipment	
• Assortment	of	drive	cables	
• Miscellaneous	cables	and	adapters 	
• Variety	of	drives	of	different	types 	
• Accepted	forensics	software,	such	as	EnCase 	and	Forensics	Tool	Kit	
(http://bit.ly/2qnSYX6) 	running	on	non -admin	lab	systems	
• Securable	 physical	 storage	for	separating	and	maintaining	evidence	chain	of	
custody	
• Video	or	audio	equipment	for	recording	findings,	evidence,	etc. 	
• Jump	Kit	(see	Jump	kit	above)	
• Certified	 computer	forensics	investigators 	
	
(iv) Procedures	and	checklists	
Specific	procedure	content	 is	unique	to	your	organization,	so	I	do	not	go	into	
much	detail.		However,	I	provide	an	incident	checklist	 (Figure	 7)	with	
recommendations	for	how	to	prepare	for	each	line	item.		You	can	download	the	
checklist	from	http://bit.ly/2qfUZtk.		This	checklist	forms	the	basis	for	your	
response	plan .	
	
		
Figure	 7:	Incident	Handling	Checklist 	
	
Section	3.02  The	Plan 	
Planning	begins	by	working	with	all	stakeholders	to	develop	an	overall	
approach	to	preparing	for	and	responding	to	an	incident.		The	discussion	that	
follows	is	a	general	overview.		Your	plans	should	include	various	attack	scenarios	
that	affect	how	you	approach	planning	and	preparedness.		Appendix	A	of	the	NIST	Computer	Security	Incident	Handling	Guide	SP	800-61	r2	(http://bit.ly/1MYR74v )	
provides	a	good	set	of	scenarios.	
	I	approach	planning	by	preparing	to	execute	each 	of	the	10	steps	in	the	
matrix	in	Figure	7.		This	ensures	every	step	is	thought	through,	documented,	and	practiced.			
	
(a) Step	1:	Begin	documentation	and	potential	evidence	preservation		
Provide	the	on -call	responder	with	the	means	to	immediately	begin	creating	
an	incident	log.		This	might	be	a	document,	spreadsheet,	or	other	template	already	
prepared	and	ready	for	use.		Further,	procedures	and	an	associated	contact	list	is	
necessary	to	begin	preserving	evidence	in	the	data	center,	in	the	office,	or	at	remote	
locations.		Initial	response	evidence	preservation	requires	training	for	 business	
managers	and	IT	personnel.		You	do	not	want	the	on-call	responder	to	take	time	detailing	preservation	steps. 	
	
(b) Step	2:	Determine	if	incident	has	occurred	
Tools	should	be	in	pl ace	to	enable	immediate	review	of	precursors	and	
indicators.		Precursors	are	log	or	other	events	that	occur	before	an	incident.		They	

	provide	insight	into	the	potential	for	an	attack.		These	might	include	social	
engineering	attempts,	phishing	emails,	unusual	network	or	system	activity,	etc.		
	Indicators	are	evidence	that	an	attack	is	in	progress.		Correlated	log	entries	
are	a	good	way	to	identify	indicator	patterns	of	certain	types	of	attacks,	 including	
unexpected	movement	of	data,	unexpected	user	access	to	resources,	unauthorized	log	modifications,	unusual /specific 	activity	at	the	firewall	or	IPS,	etc. 	
	Crest	provides	a	great	document	for	how	to	configure	and	manage	incident	
management	logging	at	http://bit.ly/2qjOP7p.		CrowdStrike	provides	a	detailed	look	
at	indicators	at	 http://bit.ly/2rUDYC8 .	
	
Once	the	responder	gathers	the	precursors	and	indicators,	he	should	
research	his	findings	using	a	knowledgebase	or	the	Internet.		Research 	sites	should	
already	be	identified	for	quick	access.		This	research	provides	insight	into	what	is	happening	and	next	steps. 		Resources	include 	
	
• Your	antimalware,	IPS,	and	SIEM	vendors	
• US-CERT	(https://www.us -cert.gov/ncas)	
• SANS	Internet	Storm	Center	(https://isc.sans.edu/dashboard.html)	
• Fee-based	cyberattack	intelligence	services 	
	
This	step	should	be	completed	in	minutes.		The	longer	it	takes	to	declare	an	
incident,	the	larger	the	impact.	
	
(c) Step	3:	Prioritize	the	incident	
Not	all	incidents	are	the	same.		Some	might	be	remediated	in	minutes.		Others	
might	take	days,	and	the	potential	impact	across	incidents	differs.		How	to	respond	
to	each	incident,	or	to	multiple	incidents	at	the	same	time,	requires	prioritization.		Prioritization	affects	who	is	contacted	and	how	response	is	initiated. 	
	Your	plan	must	include	a	quick	guide	for	how	to	prioritize	incidents.		The	on-
call	responder	and	initial	response	team	must	quickly	assess	the	seriousness	of	the	
incident	and,	again,	 decide	within	minutes	how	to	proceed.	
	Using	a	prioritization	matrix	is	one	approach.		Use	of	a	matrix	begins	with	
prioritizing	the	urgency	and	impact	of	the	incident.		Table	1	below	is	a	template	
show ing	what	this	might	look	like	(Wikipedia,	2017) .		This	approach	prioritizes	an	
incident	based	on	overall	impact	on	the	organization	and	how	fast	that	impact	might	occur.		You	can	download	 this	template	and	the	templates	for	Tables	2	and	3	from	
http://bit.ly/2qWEqkU.	
		
	
	Table	 1:	Prioritization	Categories 	
	
	

		
Table	2	is	the	actual	matrix	used	to	determine	the	priority	of	the	incident.		
Table	3	provides	guidance	on	how	 quickly	to	respond	and	the	expected	recovery	
period.		None	of	this	information	is	likely	to	be	a	perfect	fit	for	your	organization.		
Adjusting	the	downloadable	tables	is	the	first	step	in	integrating	this	into	your	
response	plan.		The	adjustment	process	re quires	close	collaboration	with	business	
representatives	and	IT	to	ensure	reasonable	and	appropriate	response	expectations. 	
	
Table	 2:	Incident	Prioritization	Matrix 	
	
		
	
Table	 3:	Incident	Priorities 	
	
	
	Finally,	the	matrix	is	a	good	general	approach,	but	you	will	not 	always	need	it	
if	certain	types	of	incidents	occur.		 Working	closely	with	the	business	during	
response	planning,	you	should 	quickly	know	when	a	response	is 	critical	because	of	
the	business	service s	or	processes	affected .		One	or	both	of	the	following	conditions	
will	usually 	result	in	a	high	priority	response 	(Wikipedia,	2017) :	
	
• Certain	(groups	of)	business-critical	services,	applications	or	infrastructure	components	are	unavailable	and	the	estimated	time	for	recovery	is	unknown	
or	exceedingly	long	( specify	services,	applications	or	infrastructure	
components,	e.g.,	the	customer	facing	order	entry	website	is	down )	

	• Certain	(groups	of)	Vital	Business	Functions	(business-critical	processes)	are	
affected	and	the	estimated	time	for	restoring	these	processes	to	full	
operating	status	is	unknown	or	exceedingly	long	( specify	business-critical	
processes,	e.g.	payroll	during	a	payroll	cycle)	
	
As	part	of	this	step,	begin	aggressive	situational	awareness	activities.	
Situational	awareness	(SA)	is	the	ability	to	understand	the	current	state	of	a	system	and	what	has	changed.		SA	is	a	continuous	process	supported	by	solutions	like	security	information	and	event	management	(http://bit.ly/2qHKiyh);	and	identity	
governance	and	administration	(http://bit.ly/2qa1cCR ).		Without	SA,	you	can	never	
quickly	detect	unwanted	behavior	and	respond	before	your	organization	suffers	serious	damage,	nor	can	you	effectively	manage	an	incident	in	progress.	
	
(d) Step	4:	Report	incident	as	specified	in	the	incident	response	communications	
plan	
Once	you	determine	an	incident	is	in	progress 	or	has	occurred,	
communicating	what	you	know	and	what	you	are	doing	about	it	to	the	right	people	
is	important.		Communication	includes	the	rest	of	the	CSIRT,	previously	identified	
managers,	and	external	s upport	organizations.		Figure	8 	(Cichonski,	Millar,	Grance,	
&	Scarfone,	2012)	depicts	external	entities	normally	included	in	a	communication	
plan.	
	
	
Figure	 8:	External	Communication 	

	How	and	when	each	of	these	entities	is	informed	is	up	to	your	team’s	public	
relations	(PR)	representative	and	C -level	management.	As	a	responder,	your	
responsibility	should	be	to	inform	your	PR	team	member	and	members	of	the	
management	team	listed	in	your	communication	plan.		In	addition,	bringing	in	the	
necessary	software	and	support	vendors	is	 incident	manager’s	responsibility.		When	
approved	by	PR	or	management,	the	CSIRT	will	communicate	directly	with	external	
teams	within	guidelines	documented	in	the	communications	plan.	
	Communication	does	not	start	with	an	incident.		Rather,	the	CSIRT 	should	
have	an	ongoing	working	relationship	with	all	outside	entities	as	part	of	incident	
preparation.		When	contacted,	external	teams	should	already	have	familiarity	wi th	
your	organization	and	your	team.		They	should	have	been	involved	in	incident	response	exercises.		No	one	should	have	to	ask	questions	that	are	not	specific	to	the	
incident	and	its	characteristics.		Again,	time	is	critical.	
	
Structured	guidelines	for	cre ating	an	incident	response	communication	plan	
are	available	for	download	from	http://bit.ly/2qu6jwZ.	
	
(e) Step	5:	Obtain	management	decision	about	forensics	preservation	and	collection	
Most	incident	response	guidance	requi res	preservation	of	evidence.		In	my	
experience,	this	is	a	secondary	consideration	for	management.		What	management	
wants	is	a	quick	return	to	normal	operation	while	mitigating	business	impact.		This	
does	not	mean	you	should	not	be	prepared	for	evidence	ga thering,	but	there	comes	
a	point	in	the	response	wh en	management	should	decide	whether	collecting	
evidence	is	more	important	than	recovery.	
	
As	you	read	earlier,	we	immediately	assume	when	an	incident	occurs	that	we	
must	preserve	all	evidence.		This	mindset	must	continue	until	management	decides	otherwise.	 	Include	in	incident	planning 	what	is	needed	to	understand	what	
happened	and	how	without	major	recovery	delays.	
	Continuous,	comprehensive	logging;	event	correlation;	and	retention	and	
protection	of	the	r esults	usually	provide	what	we	need	at	the	post	incident	root	
cause	and	action	plan	creation	meetings.		The	information	also	provides	first	steps	for	law	enforcement	if	a	path	to	prosecution	is	taken.			
	In	addition	to	logs,	we	can	also	seize	relevant	user 	devices	without	a	
significant	delay	in	recovery.		If	we	virtualize	our	servers,	previous	response	
planning	can	allow	isolation	 and	preservation	 of	the	incident -related	servers	while	
bringing	up	 replacement	virtual	servers	to	restore	business	operations.			
	
If	we	think	through	all	probable	scenarios 	during	planning ,	evidence	
collection	is	often	possible	with	what	management	might	consider	reasonable	
impact	on	the	bottom	line.		Be	sure	to	include	forensics	considerations	in	your	
preparation	activities. 	
		
(f) Step	6:	Acquire,	preserve,	and	document	evidence	as	directed	in	Step	5	
If	your	CSIRT	has	its	jump	kit	and	internal/external	forensics	lab,	it	is	ready	
to	take	on	this	step.		Also,	part	of	planning	is	ensuring	your	forensics	investigators	
are	certified	and	able 	to	collect,	analyze,	and	protect	evidence	so	the	results	stand	
up	in	a	court	of	law.		See	Section	5. 	
	
(g) Step	7:	Contain	the	incident	
Containment	is	the	most	important	part	of	loss	minimization	and	evidence	
preservation.		For	physical	attacks,	this	translates	into	delaying	an	attacker	long	
enough	for	law	enforcement	or	other	human	intervention.		Containment	for	logical	
attacks	requires	isolation	of	the	affected	systems	and	network	segments.		Isolation	
protects	uninfected 	systems	during	malware	attacks	and	helps	prevent 	a	
cybercriminal	from	extracting	data	during	a	breach.		It	also	 helps	prevent 	unwanted	
alteration	of	digital	evidence. 	
	
Although	containment	involves	processes	unique	to	each	incident,	the	overall	
approach	to	containment	is	strategic.		It	is	“…a	function	that	assists	to	limit	and	
prevent	further	damage	from	happening	along	with	ensuring	that	there	is	no	
destruction	of	forensic	evidence	that	may	[sic]	be	needed	for	legal	actions	against	
the	attackers”	 (InfoSec	Nirvana,	2015) .		Using	scenario	planning,	assess	the	need	for	
containment,	how	containment	is	achieved,	and	what	you	must	do	prior	to	an	incident	to	prepare. 	
	
(i) Physical	incidents	
I	do	not	spend	much	time	on	physical	incidents	in	this	guide.		However,	a	
brief	look	at	physical	incidents	is	important.		Sometimes,	a	physical	intrusion	precedes	a	logical 	attack.		Also,	a	device	on	your	network	might	be	used	to	launch	or	
further	an	attack	against	your	organization	or	one	remote	on	the	Internet. 	
	The	purpose	of	physical	security	is	first	to	deter	intruders	with	fences,	
guards,	signs,	etc.		Second,	we	delay	intruders	by	placing	layers	of	barriers	between	them	and	the	targets.		Examples	of	barriers	include	gates,	fences,	walls,	and	locks.		The	length	of	required	delay	depends	on	the	response	time	for	arresting	or	
otherwise	intervening	to	stop	the	intrusion.		 	
	
Barriers	alone	are	not	enough.		SA	also	applies	to	physical	attacks.		Alarms,	
cameras,	and	other	types	of	sensors	help	track	and	apprehend	an	intruder.		Also,	containing	a	crime	scene	and	related	evidence	is	necessary	if	management	decides	
to	prosecute.		If	a	device	or	system	is	used	for	an	attack	or	is	the	target	of	an	attack,	
ensure	barriers	(crime	scene	tape	and	human	oversight)	prevent 	access	by	anyone	
not	directly	involved	in	the	response	process. 	
	For	a	detailed	look	at	physical	security	for	protecting	your	information	
resources,	see	 Physical	Security:	Managing	the	intruder	(http://bit.ly/2q9I7AV).	
		
(ii) Logical	incidents	
Containing	logical	incidents	requires	 addressing 	isolation	alternatives	during	
the	SDLC	and	all	risk	assessments.		If	we	have	not	planned	for	isolation,	we	end	up	
running	through	the	data	center	unplugging	cables 	(hopefull y	labeled	cables) ,	
hoping	for	the	best.		If	you	have	ever	done	this,	you	know	isolation	is	iffy 	and	
recovery	can	take	longer. 	
	
One	of	the	most	effective	methods	of	isolation	is	use	of 	VLANs.		In	addition	to	
controlling	day-to -day	access,	VLANs	provide	the	segmentation	and	device	isolation	
needed	to	prevent,	deter,	and	contain	an	attack.		See	 VLAN	Network	Segmentation	
and	Security	(http://bit.ly/2ggAuVA).		 	
	Figure	9	shows	a	network	segmented	with	VLANs.		All	database	servers	are	
on	a	single	VLAN,	with	users	and	application	servers	on	another.		All	external	traffic	arrives	and	exits	on	other	VLANs.		VLANs	are	configured	to	prevent	devices	on	the	same	VLAN	from	communicating	with	each	other	unless	explicitly	allowed,	so	some	
isolation	is	already	built	in.		This	is	a	simple	example.		In	the	real	world,	I	would	
likely	separate	sensitive	data,	public	data,	 control	data,	and	different	business	
processes	onto	different	VLANs.			
	Figure	9	shows	how	easy	it	would	be	to	isolate	var ious	segments	of	the	
network	by	reconfiguring	one	or	two	switches.		Segmentation	is	also	possible	using	routers	in	addition	to	switches. 		Segmentation	strongly	supports	containment	
whether	you	operate	in	a	traditional,	virtual,	or	hybrid	environment.	
	
	
		
Figure	 9:	VLAN	Segmentation	 (Olzak,	2012(April))	
Quick	containment	using	network	devices	 requires	preconfigured	
reconfigurations	stored	and	easily	accessed	by	the	response	team.		This	allows	for	
rapid	isolation	once	the	threat	 agent’s	actions	are	analyzed .		One	way	to	ensure	fast	
reconfiguration	across	all	relevant	devices	is	with	a	software	defined	network	
solution	( http://bit.ly/2q7lwsq) .			
	For	end-user	devices,	the	 most	effective	isolation	approach	is	unplugging	
them	from	the	network.		Place	cell	phones,	tablets,	and	other	mobile	cellular	access	
devices	in	Faraday	bags.		Do	not	 power	them	off.		Have	a	plan	in	place	to	block	
affected	user	devices	from	connection	to	wireless	access	points	if	too	large	to	place	in	Faraday	protection.			
	
Your	containment	approach	should	enable	the	CSIRT 	to	stop	data	extrusion	
or	the	spread	of	the	attack	quickly	and	as	narrowly	as	is	reasonable	and	appropriate	for	business	operations	and	risk.		How	you	do	this 	is	unique	to	the	combination	of	
your	technology,	your	budget,	legal	ramifications,	and	management’s	appetite	for	
risk.	
	
(h) Steps	8	&	9:	Eradicate	the	Incident	and	Recover	
Steps	taken	to	eradicate	an	incident	depend	on	the	type	of	incident	and	the	
tools	and	t echniques	used	by	the	attacker.		Scenario	planning	and	comprehensive	
threat	intelligence	ensure	you	identify	all	malware,	untrusted	data	items,	
inappropriate	materials,	unwanted	registry	entries,	etc.			
	

	(i) Eliminate	exploited	vulnerabilities	
The	first	step	in	eradication	is	making	sure	the	incident	does	not	happen	
again	in	the	same	way.		Achieving	this	requires	elimination	of	the	vulnerabilities	
exploited	by	the	threat	agent.		Identification	of	these	vulnerabilities	should	be	
apparent	through	established	threat	intelligence	research	and	 results	from	your	log	
management	solution.			
	An	expeditious	process	for	fixing	vulnerabilities	 is	already	part	of	a	well -
designed	change	management	process.		Patches	and	reconfiguration	of	controls	or	systems	are	quickly	assessed,	documented,	and	applied	without	going	through	complete	change	management	sign	off.			
	If	you	make	a	change	that	does	not	work	as	expected,	reverse	it	before	trying	
something	else.		Do	not	throw	multiple	changes	at	the	incident	without	analysis	of	what	works,	what	does	not	work,	and	removal	of	anything	no	longer	needed.		Otherwise,	you	will	not	know	what	actually	saved	your	organization.		Further,	post -
incident	cleanup	will	take	much	longer	than	necessary.	
	
(ii) Remove	the	unwanted		
The	most	effective,	and	often	quickest,	approach	to	eradication	on	 user	
devices	is	a	complete	wipe	and	reinstall.		In	many	incidents,	this	is	the	only	way	to 	
be	certain	all	unwanted	entities	are	removed	from	affected	devices.		Planning	for	this	requires	creation	of	user	device	images,	including	different	configurations	
based	on	line	of	business,	department,	business	role,	etc.			Image	creation	is	part	of	
incident	planning	and	preparation. 		Initially,	this	can	be	very	time	consuming.		Once	
done,	however,	including	image	management	in	the	change	management	
procedures	makes	keeping	images	up	to	date	relatively	easy.	
	Using	server	images	is	also	effective,	but	using	virtualize d	servers	or	
containers	for 	your	critical	servers	is	 often	a	better	option.		Bringing	up	a	virtual	
machine	to	replace	a	server	isolated	in	an	incident	 quickly	achiev es	both	eradication	
and	recovery	for	that	server 	and	supported	business	processes .		Before	placing	new	
servers	in	production,	be	sure	to	eliminate	any	identified	vulnerabilities	found	in	the	
compromised	servers.			
	Finally,	we	need	to	ensure	data	integrity	and	the	absence	of	untrusted	data	
objects	in	our	databases 	and	on	our	file	server s.		The	first	preparation	step	is	
prevention	of	integrit y	compromise	with	strong	authentication	and	authorization	
controls.		Next ,	back	up	and	back 	up	often.		Your	back	up	timeline	should	represent	
the	longest	you	want	to	be	down	following	any	kind	of	busi ness	continuity	event 	
(http://bit.ly/2rakdXj ).		Protect	backups 	from	any	type	of	incident	that	might	occur	
at	any	facility.		This	usually	means	retaining	them	off	site	or	in	the	cloud.	
	Cloud	database	back	up	services,	like	those	provided	by	Microsoft	
(http://bit.ly/2rcjXJ4) ,	Oracle	(http://bit.ly/1N3eQ3j ),	and	other	cloud	service	
	providers	enable 	both	database	and	flat	file	backups	that	 provid e	data	integrity	and	
reasonable	recovery	times.		Solutions	like	Carbonite	(http://bit.ly/2bj85fH )	can	
protect	even	 the	smallest	business	with	offsite,	protected	data.		However,	faster	
recovery	times	for	your	most	time	sensitive	business	processes	might	require	
maintaining	synchronized	database	servers	at	a	colocation	(co-lo)	or	in	the	cloud.	
	
A	co-lo	is	a	data	center	placed	at	least	25	miles	from	your	primary	data	
center	that	contains	infrastructure	supporting	your	critical	business	processes .		For	
disaster	recovery	purposes,	your	co -lo	and	data	center	should	be	in	different	power	
grids,	flood	plains,	weather	corridors,	etc.		 For	attack	purposes,	the	connection	
between	the	co-lo	and	data	center	must	be	tightly	controlled.		Consider	allowing	no	remote	user	access	unless	the	data	center	or	one	of	the	critical	systems	becomes	
unavailable.	
	
Synchronize	data	between	the	co -lo	and	data	center	so	that	a	simple	change	
to	DNS,	VPN,	or	other	remote	access	methods	allow	customers	and	remote	sites	access	with	little	interruption	in	service	delivery.		Further,	office	staff	at	the	data	center	location	must	have	a	way	to	easily	access	the	co-lo	servers.			
	Always	assume	your	data	center	compromise	can	easily	pass	to	your	co-lo.		SA	
for	your	co-lo	is	also	necessary.	
	When	wipe-and -replace	or	redundant	systems	are	not	available	or	possible,	
removal	of	unwanted	items	requires	research	into	what	happened,	tools	used	by	the	attacker,	actions	taken	by	the	attacker,	files	and	executables	installed,	and	any	other	
changes	made	to	registries,	configuration	files,	etc.		Once	you	complete	this	time-
consuming	process,	the	CIRT	must	create	a	procedure	and	associated	tools	to	reverse	all	attacker	actions.		Team	members	and	other	recruited	IT	personnel	must	
then	follow	the	documented	procedure	to	eradicate	the	threat.		Unless	the	attack	
scope	was	very	small,	this	approach	might	extend	recovery	time	beyond	one	or	more	business	process	maximum	tolerable	downtimes	(http://tek.io/2rDmgC5).			
	
(iii) Recovery	
Recovery	is	focused	on	returning	business	processes	within	MTDs	defined	in	
BIAs.		Recovery	time	includes	the	time	necessary	to	restore	the	infrastructure	and	
the	time	needed	to	rebuild	data	sets.		This	is	also	known	as	the	maximum	period	of	
tolerable	downtime	(Olzak,	2013),	as	shown	in	Figure	10 .		The	RTO	(recovery	time	
objective)	is	how	long	it	takes	to	restore	supporting	technology.	
	
		
Figure	 10:	Maximum	Period	of	Tolerable	Downtime 	
	
We	previously	looked	at	eradication	methods	that	also	begin	the	recovery	
process.		Solutions	like	a	co -lo	or	a	cloud-based	redundancy	so lution	 can	quickly	
return	business	processes	to	normal.		Other	approaches	take	more	time.		Regardless	
of	how	you	approach	eradication	and	recovery,	be	sure	to	work	with	management	
to	understand	your	recovery	time	options.		This	includes	considering	the	MTD s	of	
processes	affected	by	a	downed	system:	both	upstream	and	downstream.		See	
Figure	11	(Olzak,	2013) .			
	
	
Figure	 11:	Dependent	Processes	
	
Failure	of	any	one	of	these	processes	breaks	a	chain	required	to	provide	product	to	
customers.		The	MTD	for	any	process	in	this	chain	is	the	shortest	MTD	across	all	processes:	the	chain’s	MTD.	
	
Once	you	recover	systems,	work	with	the	business	to	confirm	correct	
operation.		Check	not	only	whether	the	technology	works	as	expected,	but	also	ensure	data	integrity.		Having	predefined	reports	to	validate	data	accuracy	is	one	
way	to	quickly	do	this.	 		
	

	(i) Step	10:	Root	Cause	Analysis	and	Action	Plan	
The	last	step	in	incident	response	is	ensuring	the	same	incident	does	not	
happen	again	in	the	same	way.		Also,	you	want	to	assess	how	well	your	team	
responded	and	whether	you	can	improve ;	there 	are	always	opportunities	for	
improvement.	
	Although	you	should	have	already	blocked	one	or	more	of	the	vulnerabilities	
exploited	in	the	 current	incident,	you	need	to	understand	why	those	vulnerabilities	
existed	and	the	failure	of	controls	to	 detect	and	stop	the	attack.		Root	cause	analysis	
is	the	primary	tool	for	this.	
	Root	cause	analysis	finds	the	fundamental,	the	root,	causes	of	any	event.		It	
prevents	treating	symptoms.		Treating	only	symptoms	will	not	effectively	prevent	future,	similar	incidents.			
	
	 Cause	analysis	begins	with	bringing	together	everyone	involved	in	the	
incident	and	with	the	systems	affected.		The	resulting	meeting	must	prohibit	finger	
pointing	and	assigning	blame.		That	is	not	the	purpose	of	the	meeting.		Trying	to	place	blame	causes	attendees	to	get	defensive	and	lose	objectivity.			
	
Root	cause	is	found	by	following	the	chain s	of	cause	and	effect	leading	to	the	
incident,	as	shown	in	Figure	12	(Olzak,	2008) .		In	many	instances,	more	than	one	
root	cause	exists.		 Analysis	begins	with	the	proximate	cause	and	works	back	to	the	
root	causes.		A	proximate	cause	is	the	event	and	surrounding	conditions	that	enabled	the	incident.		The	process	used	for	this	step -back	process	varies	between	
organizations.		I	used	two	different	methods,	but	I	found	the	five-whys	approach	worked	best. 	
	
		
Figure	 12:	Root	Cause	Chain	of	Events	
An	example	of	a	five-whys	analysis	is	shown	in	Figure	13 .			In	this	example,	
ransomware	crippled	the	organization	because	a	user	fell	for	a	phishing	attack.		
With	five -whys,	you	begin	by	asking	why	 your	data	was	unavailable .		The	answer	
should	include	any 	actions	taken,	processes	executed,	and	the	conditions	under	
which	the	actions	and	executions	happened.		When	you	arrive	at	the	fifth	why,	the	root	cause	is	usually	identified.		If	not,	consider	starting	again.		You	either	missed	
something	or	the	answers	are	incorrect.		The	goal	is	to	break	the	chain	as	far	as	
possible	from	the	proximate	cause	with	new	controls	or	procedures;	or	
modifications	to	existing	controls	or	procedures.		However,	a	layered	approach 	
should	multiple	events	along	the	chain.	
	

		
Figure	 13:	Five	Whys 	
	
		

	More	than	one	root	cause	might	exist.	One	of	your	 ‘why’	answers	might	
include	two	different	causes.		Your	analysis	must	then	branch	off	to	address	both.		
Consider	each	branch	a	separate	set	of	five -whys.		You	might	separate	your	team,	so	
sub-teams	address	branches.		When	all	branches	are	complete	and	all	root	causes	identified,	the	entire	team	comes	back	together	to	complete	the	full	analysis	
diagram.	
	
You	will	not	always	know	all	the	answers	when	first	meeting.		Consequently,	
it	might	take	two	or	three	meetings	before	you	arrive	at	all	root	causes	and	create	an	
action	plan.			
	The	action	plan	is	part	of	the	final	report	to	management.		It	includes	
recom mendations	for	eliminating	root	causes	and	improving	response.		A	sample	
action	plan	is	available	for	download	from	http://bit.ly/2rtKAtT.		It	should	
minimally	include	
	
• Action	to	take	
• Priority	of	the	action 	
• Plan	to	complete	the	action 	
• Action	status	
• Person	or	team	assigned	
• Date	for	expected	completion	
	
Finally,	complete	a	full	report	on	the	incident.		Convert	your	incident	log	into	
two	stories:	one	for	management	and	one	for	your	technical	teams.		The	report	includes	documents	and	presentations.		The	presentation	to	management	includes	a	request	for	approval	for	the	action	plan	and	an	assessment	of	risk	if	one	or	more	
actions	are	not	approved.		 A	template	for	a	comprehensive	but	easy	to	reference	
incident	report	is	available	for	download	from	http://bit.ly/2sm5k3h.	
	
A	report	is	also	necessary	when	analysis	of	anomalous	behavior	is	deemed	
not	malicious.		Referring	to	these	reports	during	risk	assessments	or	during	root	
cause	analysis	might	reveal	previously	unrecognized	patterns.		A	shorter	report	is	
usually	sufficient	for	this,	and	a	template	is	available	from	http://bit.ly/2rk5Nui .	
	
Section	3.03  Section	Summary	
Planning	and	creating	the	tools	and	procedures	for	managing	an	incident	
must	happen	before	an	incident	occurs.		This	enables	reasonable	and	appropriate	prevention,	detection,	and	response. 	
	Training	team	members	on	the	plan	is	not	optional.		Everyone	on	the	CSIRT	
must	understand	his	or	her	role	and	how	to	execute	relevant	procedures.			
Tools	for	incident	response	are	uniquely	designed	for	each	organization.		
Starting	with	templates	helps	ensure	you	cover	all	areas.		In	addition	to	the	tools	
	provided	in	this	section,	the	SANS	Institute	provides	an	alternative	toolset	at	
http://bit.ly/2qASIF1.	
	Section	4.  Response 	
	
In	this	section,	we	walk	through	activities	that	might	occur	during	a	
response.		The	walk -through	assumes	you	planned	and	prepared	as	described	in	
Section	3.		I	once	again	use	the	response	checklist,	shown	in	Figure	14,	as	our	guide. 		
This	is	a	very	high -level	view	of	what	a	response	might	look	like.		Each	response	is	
unique 	to	what	is	occurring,	so	scenario	planning	as	described	in	Section	3	affects	
how	a	response	happens	and	its	effectiveness. 	
	
	
Figure	 14:	Incident	Response	Checklist 	
	
Section	4.01  Step	 1:	Begin	documentation	and	potential	evidence	preservation 	
Upon	notification	of	anomalous	network	or	device	behavior,	initiate	an	
incident	log.		Note 	
	
• Date	and	time	of	notification	
• Person	making	the	notification	
• What	the	person	reported 	
• Systems	or	networks	initially 	affected 	
	
Notify	relevant	personnel	to	minimally	
	

	• Physically	isolate	affected	user	spaces	if	a	crime	is	committed	using	a	user	
device 	
• Avoid	further	logical	or	physical	contact	with	affected	systems	or	networks	that	would	unnecessarily	modify	logs	or	wipe	content:	especially	avoid	
powering	down	 or	resetting	 affected	systems	
	
Section	4.02  Step	2:	Determine	if	incident	has	occurred 	
Using	tools	 implemented	during	planning	and	preparation,	look	for	incident	
precursors	and	indicators.		 Hopefully,	you	will 	immediately	know	what	is	happening	
or	specifically	what	to	examine	thanks	to 	automatic	threat	intelligence	associated	
with	your	security	tools.		If	not,	t he	following	list	of	things	to	check	 is	from	a	poster	
provided	by	the	SANS	Institute	at	http://bit.ly/2rkg577 .		This	resource	inclu des	
tools	for	looking	for	these	conditions	in	a	Windows	environment.		A	Linux	version	is	
also	available. 	
	
• Unusual	log	entries.			
o Did	a	log	activity	unexpectedly	stop? 	
o Are	there	many	failed	login	attempts	or	locked	out	accounts?	
o Are	logs	unexpectedly	accessed	or	modified?	
• Unusual	network	usage.	
o Have	any	new	and	unusual	file	shares	appeared? 	
o Are	unusual	sessions	open	on	servers	or	user	devices?	
o Is	a	large	quantity	of	data	moving	in	unexpected	ways?	
o Are	unexpected	sessions	open	between	internal	systems	or	between	
internal	and	external	systems?	
• Unusual	files	and	registry	keys.	
o Has	there	been	a	major	increase	or	decrease	in	disk	free	space?	
o Are	there	unusually	large	files?	
o Are	there	strange	programs	associated	with	system	start	up?	
o Is	bulk	file	encryption	occurri ng?	
• Unusual	scheduled	tasks.	
o Are	there	unusual	tasks	running	as	admin,	SYSTEM,	or	a	blank	user	
name?	
• Unusual	accounts.	
o Are	there	 new,	unexpected	accounts	in	the	administrator	groups:	local	
or	domain?	
• Other.	
o Are	servers	or	user	devices	performing	sluggishly?	
o Are	there	unusual	system	crashes?	
o Is	there	anything	else	happening	that	is	unexpected	given	up -to-date	
network	and	system	baselines	you	previously	documented?	
	
If	you	have	the	right	tools	in	place	(SIEM,	IPS,	firewalls,	etc.),	you	will	likely	
see	much	of	what	you	need	to	know	in	a	security	management	portal:	at	least	you	
should.		In	any	case,	you	will	want	to	refer	to	the	list	above	when	determining	what	
	you	know	and	what	you	do	not.		Whiteboards	with	discovered	information	are	a	
good	tool	for	helping	 your	entire	team	quickly	gain	insights	in	the	incident.			
	Once	you	collect	sufficient	information,	use	your	previously	identified	
resources	to	research	what	might	be	the	cause	of	your	findings.		If	you	find	nothing	malicious	occurring,	complete	a	short-form	report	and	stop	the	incident	process.	
	
Section	4.03  Step	3:	Prioritize	the	incident	and	establish	situational	awareness 	
Use	a	tool	like	the	matrix	in	Section	3	to	prioritize	the	incident	based	on	
urgency	and	impact.		Assign	a	previously	designated	and	trained	initial	CSIRT	member	to	continuously	monitor	for	conditions	in	Step	2	throughout	the	response	process.		This	includes	targets	thought	to	be	compromised	and	all	critical	devices	
and	networks.		Isolation	does	not	always	work	as	expected. 	
	
Section	4.04  Step	4:	Report	inci dent	as	specified	in	communications	plan 	
Using	the	previously	defined	communication	plan,	notify	the	CSIRT	members	
and	appropriate	management	of	a	probable	incident.		Be	sure	to	have	available	for	distribution	the	initial	response	activities	recorded	in	th e	log	started	in	Step	1. 		The	
CSIRT	establishes	the	incident	command	center	and	begins	detailed	analysis.		Analysis	never	stops	as	additional	information	is	gathered.	
	
Section	4.05  Step	5:	Obtain	management	forensics	evidence	collection	decision 	
The	initial	response	should	have	already	taken	steps	to	protect	evidence.		At	
this	point,	management	must	decide	whether	to	continue	forensics	processes	or	focus	on	business	process	recovery.		Information	needed	for	this	decision	includes	
evidence	collection	impact	on	how	long	affected	business	processes	might	be	down	and	what	evidence	is	already	available	without	delays	(see	Section	3).		Also	relevant	
is	the	probability	that	detailed	evidence	collection	has	value	given	the	type	of	attack	
and	the	threat	agent	involved. 	
	
Section	4.06  Step	6:	A cquire,	preserve,	and	protect	evidence 	
I	address	this	process	in	Section	5. 	
	
Section	4.07  Step	7:	Contain	the	incident 	
Although	this	step	appears	late	in	the	process,	it	should	be	something	that	
happens	quickly	once	an	incident	is	identified.		For	example,	the	on-call	responder	
should	have	the	skills	and	toolset	to	quickly	isolate	key	network	segments	after	
performing	Step	2.		In	Step	7,	detailed	analysis	by	the	CSIRT	and	situational	awareness	information	provide	the	need	for	additional	containment	activities.	
	Also	in	this	step,	virtual	servers	and	newly	imaged	spare	user	devices	can	be	
activated	to	reduce	business	process	downtime.		Depending	on	how	the	incident	is	
contained	and	the	processes	affected,	recovery	does	not	necessarily	have	to	wait	
until	after	eradication.		However,	be	sure	these	systems	will	not	be	compromised	
	again	using	the	same	vulnerabilities.		This	often	requires	patching	or	a	quick	
reconfiguration	of	a	network	device	or	control. 	
	
Section	4.08  Step	 8:	Eradicate	the	incident 	
At	this	point,	SA	and	additional	analysis	should	provide	enough	information	
about	the	threat	agent	and	related	tools	and	techniques	for	eradication.		The	CSIRT	documents	a	plan	for	eradication,	including	scripts	and	other	tools	for	malware	and	
other	unwanted	digital	entities,	and	quickly	trains	 response	personnel	on	how	to	
execute	it.		 	
	
The	eradication	plan	includes	predefined	expeditious	change	documentation	
for	exploited	vulnerabilit y	management.		Changes	include	quick	modifications	to	
existing	network	devices,	operating	system s,	business	 application s,	and	security	
controls	configurations. 	
	
Section	4.09  Step	 9:	Recover	
With	proper	planning,	recovery	began	in	Step	7	and	continued	through	Step	
8.		What	has	not	occurred	yet	is	verification	of	data	integrity.		Use	tools	and	procedures	selected	and	documented	during	preparation	to	verify	or	recover	flat	
file	and	database	data	accuracy	and	authenticity.		Remove	all	containment	
restrictions	and	work	with	business	users	to	ensure	affected	business	processes	work	as	expected :	producing	valid	results. 	
	
Section	4.10  Step	10:	Ro ot	cause	analysis	and	reporting 	
Gather	all	personnel	involved	in	incident	impact	and	response	to	perform	an	
after-action	root	cause	analysis.		Complete	a	detailed	response	report	and	presentations	for	both	management	and	technical	teams.		The	report	should	include	
an	action	plan	for	management	approval	and	detailed	improvement	of	both	security	
controls/procedures	and	response	activities. 	
	
Section	4.11  Section	Summary	
This	section	provides	a	strong	foundation	for	a	documented	response	plan.		
Based	on	a	checklist,	it	give s	you	general	actions	to	take	as	you	step	through	any	
type	of	incident.		Again,	the	type	of	incident	determines	specific	actions.		Therefore,	
training	with	various	attack	scenarios	is	a	necessary	part	of	planning	and	
preparation.	
	
	Section	5.  Initial	Response	Forensics 	
	
A	detailed	discussion	of	digital	forensics	investigation	is	outside	the	scope	of	
this	guide.		What	is	important	in	any	response	guide	is	how	 to	initial ly	preserve	
evidence	for	forensics	investigations.		That	is	what	I	cover	in	this	section.		For	a	
deeper	look	at	digital	forensics	investigations ,	see

Response	( http://bit.ly/2qKq9nP)

Section	5.01  Forensics	Overview 	
Generally,	forensics	is	the	collection,	examination,	analysis,	and	reporting	of	
evidence	used	in	identifying	and	prosecuting	perpetrators	of	a	crime.		Digital	forensics	is	 “the	application	of	science	to	the	identification,	collection,	examination,	
and	analysis	of	data	while	preserving	the	information	and	maintaining	a	strict	chain	of	custody” 	(Kent,	Chevalier,	Grance,	&	Dang,	2006,	pp.	ES -1).			
	
The	process	of	digital	forensics,	as	shown	in	Figure	15,	is	the	collection	of	
digital	media,	the	careful	extraction	of	data	from	that	media,	correlation	of	the	data	to	create	meaningful	information	about	the	crime,	and	providing	credible	reports	
showing	relevant	evidence	for	or	against	one	or	more	suspects.		Throughout	this	process,	initial	responders	and	forensics	investigators	must	ensure	evidence	
integrity.		Evidence	integrity	is	ensured	by 	
	
• Establishing	a	strict	chain	of	custody	as	soon	as	potential	evidence	is	collected 	
• Using	only	forensically	acceptable	methods	of	extracting	data	from	media	
• Never	using	original	media	for	analysis	
• Creating	forensic	copies	of	media	for	analysis	with	hash	values	calculated	
immediately	after	the	copy	is	complete	and	before	the	start	of	analysis	
• Allowing	only	authorized,	tracked	personnel	access	to	the	crime	scene,	forensics	lab,	and	other	areas	where	evidence	is	collected	or	analyzed 	
• Isolating	all	analysis	systems	from	networks	external	to	the	lab,	especially	the	Internet	
• Using	only	forensics	tools	known	to	be	acceptable	to	the	forensics	community	and	generally	acceptable	in	legal	proceedings	
	• Being	able	to	demonstrate	the	professional,	skilled	status	of	the	forensics	
investigators	in	legal	proceedings	
	
	
Figure	 15:	Digital	 Forensics 	
	
Evidence	preservation	and	chains	of	custody	begin	with	the	initial	
responders.		The	rest	of	this	section	describes	how	they	must	work	to	preserve	the	
integrity	of	evidence	before	arrival	of	forensics	investigators.	
	
Section	5.02  Protecting	Digital	Evidence 	
We	have	already	discussed	 in	previous	sections	the	importance	of	securely	
maintaining	logs	and	other	information	gathered	during	daily	monitoring.		These	form	the	foundation	for	forensics	work.		However,	we	also	need	contents	of	swap	files	and	memory,	in	some	cases,	to	supplement	our	log	information.		Consequently,	
we	must	never	allow	anyone	to	reset	or	power	off	any	potentially	affected	devices	
until	management	decides	how	far	to	proceed	with	evidence	collection.		
Ensuring	proper	handling	of	user	devices	during	an	incident	requires	
training	at	least	our	business	managers	on	what	to	do	and	not	to	do	when	an	
incident	is	suspected.		In	my	experience,	resetting	or	powering	off	a	device	is	a	
common	first	step	by	management.		Another	management	action	is	often	sitting	in	front	of	a	possibly	compromised	system,	or	one	that	was	used	in	the	commission	of	
a	crime,	to	“explore.”		All	these	actions	must	be	stopped	by	policy	and	training.	
	
IT	personnel	must	also	protect	evidence	in	data	centers.		Once	an	incident	is	
suspected,	a	hands-off	policy	must	be	enforced.		The	only	exceptions	are	containment	activities	defined	and	directed	by	the	response	team.		Reaching	this	
outcome	requires	training	and	practice .	
	

	The	hands-off	conditions	must	continue	until	the	digital	forensics	
investigators	take	over	or	until	management	decides	to	forego	detailed	evidence	
collection. 	
	
Section	5.03  Securing	a	Potential	Crime	Scene 	
If	an	office,	cubicle,	conference	room,	or	other	physical	space	is	suspected	of	
use	during	an	incident,	 you	must	secure	it	immediately.		First	steps	include	placing	
someone	at	the	entrance	to	the	area	to	block	all	access.		Ideally,	this	would	be	a	
security	guard.		The	initial	securing	of	the	scene	is	the	responsibility	of	relevant	
managers	and	should	take	place	before	arrival	of	 initial	responders.	
	
As	quickly	as	possible,	the	CSIRT	should	dispatch	initial	responders	to	the	
site.		The	following	steps	taken	upon	arrival	are	modified	recommendations	from	the	NIST’s	 Crime	Scene	Investigation:	A	Guide	for	Law	Enforcement	
(http://bit.ly/2rN9swT) .		When	performing	these	steps,	the	guiding	principle	is	to	
avoid	anything	but	minimal	contamination	and	disturbance	of	evidence.	
	
1. Begin	log	with	notification	of	incident	(date/time,	address/location,	type	of	incident,	and	parties	involved)	and	then	log	every	action	taken	and	observation	 made	at	the	scene	
2. Be	aware	of	any	persons	leaving	the	scene 	
3. Approach	the	scene	cautiously,	scan	the	entire	area	to	thoroughly	assess	the	
scene,	and	note	any	possible	secondary	scenes	
4. Ensure	no	one	is	still	using	any	device	or	accessing	any	physical	materials	at	
the	scene	
5. Be	aware	of	any	persons	in	the	vicinity	that	may	be	related	to	the	crime	
a. Secure	and	separate	suspects 	
b. Secure	and	separate	witnesses 	
c. Determine	if	bystanders	are	witnesses 	and	secure	and	separate	as	
appropriate 	
d. Exclude	unauthorized	and	nonessential	personnel	from	the	scene,	including	managers	demanding	access	
6. Make	initial	observations	to	assess	the	scene	and	ensure	human	safety	before	
proceeding 	
7. Ensure	human	injuries	are	treated	
8. Remain	alert	and	attentive,	and	assume	the	crime	is	ongoing	until	otherwise	
determined	
9. Treat	the	location	as	a	crime	scene	until	assessed	and	determined	to	be	
otherwise 		
a. Use	crime	scene	tape	to	identify	and	contain	all	related	locations	
b. Log	all	persons	entering	and	exiting	the	scene 	
i. Time	
ii. Name	
iii. Contact	information	
iv. Reason 	
	10. Photograph	the	scene 	(and	create	sketches	when	photographs	do	not	capture	
enough	details	of	what	you	see)	
a. Walls 	
b. Floor	
c. Desktops	
d. Computer	and	handheld	device	screens	
11. Carefully	place	mobile	devices	(phones	and	tablets)	into	Faraday	bags	
without	powering	them	off	and	create	a	chain	of	custo dy	form	for	each	
collected	device 	
12. After	photographing	all	connectors	and	original	locations	of	the	devices,	unplug	all	network	cab les	and	ensure	the	CSIRT	has	blocked	all	wireless	
access	for	these	devices 	
13. Wait	for	arrival	of	forensic s	investigators ,	and	upon	their	arrival 	
a. Provide	detailed	briefing	of	your	actions	and	current	state	of	 the	
scene,	witnesses,	suspects,	evidence,	etc.	 	
b. Turn	over	all	materials	and	evidence	with	proper	chain	of	custody	
c. Assist	as	requested	
	Just	as	forensics	investigators	must	be	trained	professionals,	initial	
responders	must	have	a	thorough	understanding	of	what	steps	to	take	in	any	situation.		This,	again ,	requires	frequent	scenario -based	training.		The	checklist	
shown	in	Figure	16,	and	downloadable	from	http://bit.ly/2sn0ROz ,	is	a	good	 start	
for	a	reference	 and	response	management	tool	for	 initial	responders.			
	
	
Figure	 16:	Initial	Response	Team	Checklist	
	
The	checklist	tasks	are	not	 necessarily	 listed	in	the	order	in	which	they	are	to	
be	completed.		A	first	response	team	lead	should	assign	tasks	to	herself	and	other	team	members,	and	some	tasks	should	be	done	simultaneously,	if	possible.		These	include	identification	and	separation	of	witnesses,	securing	and	separating	suspects,	

	ensuring	no	unauthorized	individuals	are	in	or	will	enter	the	crime	scene,	and	
isolation	of	mobile	and	other	devices	from	network	access.	
	
Section	5.04  Section	Summary	
First	steps	taken	by	business	users	and	management	are	an	important	part	of	
initial	response.		Part	of	security	training,	at	least	for	managers,	should	be	what	to	do	and	what	not	to	do	when	they	suspect	an	incident .	
	The	CSIRT	initial	response	team	must	work	closely	with	management	once	
they	arrive	on	the	scene.		Managing	employees,	collecting	evidence,	and	other	activities	need	management	cooperation.		You	are	not	law	enforcement.		Someone	in	authority	must	assist	to	avoid	unnecessary	confrontations	and	delays. 	
	Before	arrival	of	the	forensics	investigator,	only	perform	those	steps	
necessary	to	ensure	human	safety,	preserve	evidence,	and	gather	witnesses/suspects.		Log	everything	you	do	or	see.		Take	photographs	bef ore	
touching	anything.		Create	sketches	in	cases	in	which	a	photograph	is	not	quite	
enough.
