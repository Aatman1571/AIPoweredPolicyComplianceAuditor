      "justification": "The policy effectively addresses the core requirement of information classification and labeling, specifying the correct categories (Confidential, Internal, Public). However, it fails to address the governance aspect of the control, specifically the requirement that the 'Information Classification Policy' (which this snippet appears to be part of or represent) must be 'referenced in the Acceptable Use Policy'. The provided policy snippet does not contain any such cross-reference, which is a explicit part of the control.",
      "domain": "security_governance",
      "remediation": "Amend the 'Information Classification' section in the policy to explicitly reference the 'Information Classification Policy' and the 'Acceptable Use Policy'. This ensures that the policy aligns with the control's expectation that classification and labeling procedures are defined in a separate Information Classification Policy, and that user awareness and compliance are addressed via the Acceptable Use Policy. \n\n**Revised Policy Text Example:**\n\n**3. Information Classification:** All data must be classified (Confidential, Internal, Public) and appropriately labeled, in accordance with the detailed guidelines provided in the organization's **Information Classification Policy**. User responsibilities and acceptable handling practices are further defined in the **Acceptable Use Policy**."
