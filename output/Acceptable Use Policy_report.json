The policy, however, specifically limits its scope to 'The user interface for information contained on Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems,' which is a much narrower scope than general information labelling (e.g., for documents, emails, databases, physical media).\n2.  **Missing Classification Level:** The control explicitly lists 'Confidential, Internal, Public' as required classification levels. The policy only mentions 'confidential or non-confidential' for user interfaces, and does not explicitly address or define 'Internal' as a distinct classification level within its own stated scope, or explicitly map 'non-confidential' to 'Internal' and 'Public'. While 'non-confidential' might broadly cover 'Internal' and 'Public', the control asks for specific levels to be addressed.\n3.  **Direct Definition vs. Delegation:** While delegating to another policy is fine for detailed definitions, the control asks the policy to 'Define and implement labelling requirements'. The provided snippet mostly delegates without providing sufficient detail or explicitly stating *how* labelling is implemented beyond the UI classification for specific systems. It doesn't elaborate on the 'requirements' themselves.\n\nTherefore, while the policy identifies classification and points to a source for detailed guidance, it does not fully define or implement comprehensive labelling requirements for all information, nor does it explicitly address all required classification levels within its directly stated scope.",

The control, however, explicitly requires *enforcement* of encryption. A recommendation is insufficient to meet an enforcement requirement.\n3.  **Access Controls:** The policy makes no mention of enforcing access controls whatsoever.\n4.  **Alignment with AUP:** The policy does not mention alignment with an Acceptable Use Policy.\n5.  **Sensitive Data Examples:** The policy correctly identifies examples of sensitive data (e.g., NCIC, CJIS information), aligning with the control's examples of information requiring protection.",
